<h3>Program of Study</h3>




<p>Anthropology encompasses a variety of historical and comparative approaches to human cultural and physical variety, ranging from the study of human evolution and prehistory to the study of cultures as systems of meaningful symbols. Anthropology involves, at one extreme, natural science such as anatomy, ecology, genetics, and geology; at the other, various social sciences and humanities ranging from psychology, sociology, and linguistics to philosophy, history, and comparative religion. Anthropology can lead (through graduate study) to careers in research and teaching in university and museum settings. More often it provides a background for further work in other disciplines of the social sciences, humanities, and biological sciences, as well as for professional careers in government, business, law, medicine, social services, and other fields.</p>




<p>For more information, see the <a href="http://anthropology.uchicago.edu">department website</a>.</p>

<a class="topnav" style="float: right; display: none;" href="#top" onClick="hideNav()">Back To Top</a>
<h3>Program Requirements</h3>




<p>Students should confer with the Director of Undergraduate Studies before declaring a major in anthropology and must obtain the endorsement of the Director of Undergraduate Studies on the <em>Student Program Form</em> before graduating with a major in anthropology. The BA program in anthropology consists of thirteen courses, of which at least eleven are typically chosen from those listed or cross-listed as Department of Anthropology courses. A minimum of three must be chosen from the introductory group (ANTH 211xx, 212xx, 213xx, 214xx, 216xx), plus eight others. The additional two related courses may be courses offered by other departments. <em>Approval must be obtained from the Director of Undergraduate Studies in Anthropology (preferably before the end of the second week of the quarter in which the student is enrolled in the nondepartmental course), by providing a completed General Petition Form and syllabus for the course(s).</em></p>




<p>Students are encouraged to construct individual programs; and, in so doing, they should consult periodically with the Preceptor and the Director of Undergraduate Studies. We strongly urge students who are majoring in anthropology to complete several introductory courses before enrolling in upper-level courses. For a broad view of the human career and condition, one should include courses in archaeological, linguistic, physical, and sociocultural anthropology.</p>




<p>Courses numbered ANTH 211xx through 216xx do not presume any previous study of anthropology and may be taken in any order. <em>However, students are strongly urged to take one of the following social sciences general education sequences before taking more advanced courses in sociocultural anthropology:</em></p>

<p>ANTH 211xx, 212xx, 213xx, 214xx, and 216xx are introductions to some of the substantive, methodological, and theoretical issues of sociocultural, archaeological, linguistic, and physical anthropology. Particularly recommended for a firm foundation in the discipline are at least one Reading Ethnographies (ANTH 216xx) course and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ANTH 21420" title="ANTH 21420" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ANTH 21420');">ANTH 21420</a> The Practice of Anthropology: Ethnographic Methods</span>. Students with a program of study that emphasizes sociocultural anthropology also are encouraged to take one or more of the non-Western civilization sequences: African, South Asian, and Latin American. These sequences typically feature anthropological approaches and content. With prior approval, other civilization sequences can be taken for anthropology credit (up to the two-course limit for nondepartmental courses) in accordance with the individual student's needs or interests.</p>





<p>The Director of Undergraduate Studies may refer students who wish to emphasize archaeological, linguistic, sociocultural, or physical anthropology to faculty in these fields for assistance in the development of their individual programs.</p>




<p>When desirable for a student's individual anthropology program and with the approval of the Director of Undergraduate Studies, preferably in advance, a student may also obtain course credit for supervised individual reading or research (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ANTH 29700" title="ANTH 29700" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ANTH 29700');">ANTH 29700</a> Readings in Anthropology</span>), as well as by attending field schools or courses offered by other universities (up to the two-course limit for nondepartmental courses). A maximum of two research credits (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ANTH 29700" title="ANTH 29700" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ANTH 29700');">ANTH 29700</a> Readings in Anthropology</span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ANTH 29900" title="ANTH 29900" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ANTH 29900');">ANTH 29900</a> Preparation of Bachelor's Essay</span>) will count as additional anthropology courses beyond the required three introductory courses.</p>

<h3>Honors</h3>




<p>Students who wish to be considered for honors must apply to the Director of Undergraduate Studies before the end of their third year. Eligible candidates must have a GPA of 3.6 or higher in courses in the major and typically a GPA of 3.25 overall. To receive honors, students must develop an extended piece of research via a bachelor's essay under the approved supervision of a faculty member. Registration in <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ANTH 29900" title="ANTH 29900" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ANTH 29900');">ANTH 29900</a> Preparation of Bachelor's Essay</span> may be devoted to the preparation of the senior honors essay. For award of honors, the essay must receive a grade of A or A- from the faculty supervisor and from the second reader who were approved by the Director of Undergraduate Studies. Students being recommended for honors must submit two copies of the completed paper to the Program Administrator no later than fifth week of the quarter of graduation. The faculty supervisor must be chosen from among anthropology faculty listed below. The second reader may be any credentialed scholar/scientist approved by the Director of Undergraduate Studies.</p>





<p>This program may accept a BA paper or project used to satisfy the same requirement in another major if certain conditions are met. Approval from both program chairs is required. Students should consult with the chairs by the earliest BA proposal deadline (or by the end of their third year, if neither program publishes a deadline). A consent form, to be signed by both chairs, is available from the College adviser. It must be completed and returned to the College adviser by the end of Autumn Quarter of the student's year of graduation.</p>

This course in political and environmental anthropology focuses on how renewable energy forms (like solar, wind, biofuel, and geothermal) have become increasingly important sites of political activity, commercial opportunity and social imagination across the world. Against the backdrop of an enduring geopolitics and geoeconomics of petroleum, coal, and nuclear power, of transnational activist and governmental discourse on sustainability, and of local concerns about resource entitlement and cultural sovereignty, we examine how clean energy forms are being imagined, developed, institutionalized, and contested in a variety of places across the world. In each case, we explore the unique social life of an emergent technology and source of power.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

<p class="courseblocktitle"><strong>ANTH&#160;21107.  Classical Readings in Anthropology: Anthropological Theory.  100 Units.</strong></p><p class="courseblockdesc">
Since its inception as an academically institutionalized discipline, anthropology has always addressed the relation between a self-consciously modernizing West and its various and changing others. Yet it has not always done so with sufficient critical attention to its own concepts and categories—a fact that has led, since at least the 1980s, to considerable debate about the nature of the anthropological enterprise and its epistemological foundations. This course provides a brief critical introduction to the history of anthropological thought over the course of the discipline's long twentieth century, form the 1880s to the present. Although we focus on the North American and British traditions, we review important strains of French and, to a lesser extent, German social theory in chronicling the emergence and transformation of modern anthropology as an empirically based, but theoretically informed, practice of knowledge production about human sociality and culture.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

We stress a variety of traditional theoretical concerns of the broader Mesoamerican region stressed (e.g., the validity of reconstructive ethnography; theories of agrarian community structure; religious revitalization movements; the constitution of such identity categories as indigenous, Mayan, and Yucatecan). In this respect, the course can serve as a general introduction to the anthropology of the region. The relevance of these area patterns for general anthropological debates about the nature of culture, history, identity, and social change are considered.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

Contemporary China is often spoken of as undergoing deep and rapid social change. Certainly globalizing forces have been especially evident in all parts of China over the last couple of decades. At the same time, like the rest of East Asia and the Pacific Rim, China has developed distinctive social, cultural, and political forms, many of which circulate nationally and transnationally. This course comes to terms with both the processes of change that have characterized the last few decades and with a few recent social and cultural phenomena of interest. Because the scholarly literature lags behind the pace of transformation in China, we draw on a wide variety of materials: ethnography, memoir, fiction, films, essays, historical studies, short stories, websites. Emphasis in class discussions is on grasping how contemporary Chinese realities are experienced from viewpoints within China—this is the sense in which the course is intensive study of a "culture." Readings and materials are divided into several major units concerned with historical memory, rural China, urban life, labor migration, and popular culture. Students undertake, as a term project, their own investigation of some aspect of contemporary cultural change in China.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

Celts and things Celtic have long occupied a prominent and protean place in the popular imagination, and "the Celts" has been an amazingly versatile concept in the politics of identity and collective memory in recent history. This course is an anthropological exploration of this phenomenon that examines: (1) the use of the ancient past in the construction of modern nationalist mythologies of Celtic identity (e.g., in France and Ireland) and regional movements of resistance to nationalist and colonialist project (e.g., in Brittany, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Gallicia, Asturias); (2) the construction of transnational ethno-nostalgic forms of Celtic identity in modern diasporic communities (Irish, Scottish, etc.); and (3) various recent spiritualist visions of Celticity that decouple the concept from ethnic understandings (e.g., in the New Age and Neo-Pagan movements). All of these are treated in the context of what is known archaeologically about the ancient peoples of Europe who serve as a symbolic reservoir for modern Celtic identities. The course explores these competing Celtic imaginaries in the spaces and media where they are constructed and performed, ranging from museums and monuments, to neo-druid organizations, Celtic cyberspace, Celtic festivals, Celtic theme parks, Celtic music, Celtic commodities, etc.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

<p class="courseblocktitle"><strong>ANTH&#160;22535.  Engaging Media: Thinking about Media and Their Audiences.  100 Units.</strong></p><p class="courseblockdesc">
In the first part of the course we look at how post–World War II mass communications and “classical” film theory theorized communication and spectatorship; in particular, we trace the dialogue between these liberatory models and the totalitarianism and propaganda (i.e., top-down models of control) of the times. We then look at theories of mass media reception and spectatorship that put ideology at the center of their analysis, interrogating theories of the “receiver” of media messages as cultural dope (Frankfurt school Marxism), psychoanalytic and (post-)Marxist theories of spectatorship (“Screen” theory), feminist critiques of film spectatorship, and reactions to the above in cognitivist film studies. We then turn to British Cultural Studies’ theories of media, focusing on how such work attempts to reconcile models of reception as ideologically unproblematic and as determined by the ideological structures of production and reception. Particular focus is given to the theoretical arguments regarding ideology and media, the notion of “code,” and the differences and similarities in the model of communication with the sociology of mass communication. In the second half of the course we look at anthropological approaches to media and how anthropologists have taken up the issue of media reception. Why have anthropologists largely ignored media and reception studies until recently? What kinds of contributions can anthropology make to the theorization and methodological approach to reception? By critically looking at ethnographies of reception, we problematize the concept of reception proper, looking at more holistic ways of dealing with the issue of the mediation of social life. In the final part of the course we re-evaluate what we mean by “mass media” and “reception.” First we look media (con)texts that blur the duality of production/reception. We then consider new forms of media and to what extent “reception” as a category even makes sense in attempting to understand how engagement with such new media functions.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

<p class="courseblocktitle"><strong>ANTH&#160;22606.  Indigeneities.  100 Units.</strong></p><p class="courseblockdesc">
Depending on how you look at it, questions of indigeneity—the who, how, what, and why of peoples that either identify, or are identified, as “native”—are questions that at once transcend, entail, and/or are produced by Euro-American scholarly, political, and legal inquiry. Whether assailed as the product of colonial orientalism or celebrated as the ur-subjectivity of those who resist it (or something in between), the claims of, to, and about indigeneity continue to excite and demand attention scholarly and political. Indeed some argue that politics of indigeneity have gained unique traction in recent decades, as indigenous actors, scholars, and their advocates have pressed for changes to legal, political, and cultural/scientific regimes that have indigenous affairs as their chief objects of inquiry. One need only consider the 2007 passage of the UN Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the legal decisions acknowledging the force of native title in the Supreme Courts of Australia and Canada, and even the changes in various regimes of research concerning the social scientific study of native peoples and/or the representation of their material culture, all of which happened less than 20 years ago. Despite these long-standing interests and recent social, politica,l and economic gains, indigenous communities remain among the most vulnerable in the world. These trenchant inequalities beg the question, how does the condition of indigeneity relate to the various social forces shaping the world today and to the lived experiences of those who claim to be, or get named as, indigenous. It is towards an exploration of this question that this course is dedicated. Among the lines of inquiry that we will pursue in the course are: (1) tracing the genealogies of indigeneity as a notion, both in Euro-American human sciences and in other epistemological traditions; (2) considering the role that notions of indigeneity play in contemporary national and international political regimes; (3) exploring how indigeneity is claimed or disclaimed, by different peoples around the world, and why; and (4) considering the ways in which notions of indigeneity are being figured in new regimes of possession and commodification, including intellectual property, genetics and genome mapping, and the role of indigenous knowledge in resource extraction and bioprospecting. In pursuing these questions this course will endeavor to tease out the manifold relationships that the rising politics of indigeneity at the dawn of the 21st century has to other global political economic phenomena. Simultaneously, the course will also attend to the ways in which different peoples, caught up in different sociopolitical milieu, orient to the notion of indigeneity as it articulates with their lived experiences with matters of autochthony (the state of being “from here”), allochthony (being “from elsewhere”), and the consequences of those distinctions to their everyday lives.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

<p class="courseblocktitle"><strong>ANTH&#160;22609.  Indigenous Methodologies.  100 Units.</strong></p><p class="courseblockdesc">
 The 1969 publication of Vine Deloria Jr.’s <em>Custer Died for your Sins</em> forever changed the landscape for academic research with indigenous communities in North America, if not the world. Declaring, “Indians have been cursed above all other peoples in history. Indians have anthropologists.”(Deloria 1988[1969]: 78), Deloria’s broadside was aimed at a social science academy whose research methods, ethics, and findings he felt offered little concrete benefit to the indigenous peoples whose lives they studied. Whether accurate or not, the critique sent ripples not only through the academy, but through policy circles and the native communities themselves, inaugurating a period of remarkable refiguring of the legal, scholarly, and interpersonal landscapes against which social science research on indigenous peoples is constituted. This refiguring has emerged in a variety of modes and with different effects and outcomes. In this course, students will be introduced to the evolving ethics, methods, policies, and epistemologies shaping social science research with indigenous communities in North America. In addition, in the second half of the quarter, students will get firsthand experience working on issues of relevance to social science research with indigenous communities under the supervision of Prof. Richland and leadership at two institutions in Chicago—the Title VII American Indian Education Program and the North American Anthropology Division of the Field Museum. In this part of the course, students will be paired up and work on independent projects that are designed to address the needs and interests of these organizations and the indigenous peoples with which they work, and then to initiate their own academic inquiry alongside those projects. These projects will provide you with an opportunity to understand and implement the theories, ethics, and methods learned in class, revealing the rewards and challenges of conducting research programs that engage leading theories and debates in the academy while also making real contributions to the indigenous communities with which students are working.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

Finished, monological utterances? Conditions of possibility? Strait gates through time? Weber, Bakhtin, and Benjamin provide insights and analytical tools of unsurpassed power. Scholars who use them best have faced and made key decisions about social ontology and social science epistemology, decisions that follow from specific, radical propositions about society and social science made by these theorists and others they engage, starting at least from Immanuel Kant. This course is designed for any student who wants to more clearly understand the arguments of Weber, Bakhtin, and Benjamin, and to understand more broadly the remarkable trajectories of German social theory after Kant. It is designed especially for anyone hoping to use some of their conceptions well in new research. (Yes, Bakhtin is Russian, and cultural theory in Russia and the U.S. too will come up.) Fair warning: this course focuses on four roads out of Kant’s liberal apriorism (including culture theory from Herder to Boas and Benedict, as well as Benjamin and the dialectical tradition, Bakhtin’s dialogism, and Weber’s historical realism). We will spend less time on good examples of current use of Weber’s, Bakhtin’s, and Benjamin’s ideas than on the writings of Weber, Bakhtin, and Benjamin themselves, and their predecessors and interlocutors (including Herder, Hegel, Clausewitz, Marx, Ihering, and Simmel). The premise of the course is that you will do more in your own research with a roadmap than with templates.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

There is a substantial portion of the psychological nature of human beings that is neither homogeneous nor fixed across time and space. At the heart of the discipline of cultural psychology is the tenet of psychological pluralism, which states that the study of "normal" psychology is the study of multiple psychologies and not just the study of a single or uniform fundamental psychology for all peoples of the world. Research findings in cultural psychology thus raise provocative questions about the integrity and value of alternative forms of subjectivity across cultural groups. In this course we analyze the concept of "culture" and examine ethnic and cross-cultural variations in mental functioning with special attention to the cultural psychology of emotions, self, moral judgment, categorization, and reasoning.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

Contemporary human foodways are not only highly differentiated in cultural and social terms, but often have long and complicated histories. Anthropologists have long given attention to food. But, until quite recently, they did so in an unsystematic, haphazard fashion. This course explores several related themes with a view towards both the micro- and macro-politics of food by examining a range of ethnographic and historical case studies and theoretical texts. It takes the format of a seminar augmented by lectures (during the first few weeks), scheduled video screenings, and individual student presentations during the rest of the course.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

Alcohol is the most widely used psychoactive agent in the world, and, as archaeologists have recently demonstrated, it has a very long history dating back at least 9,000 years. This course will explore the issue of alcohol and drinking from a trans-disciplinary perspective. It will be co-taught by an anthropologist/archaeologist with experience in alcohol research and a neurobiologist who has experience with addiction research. Students will be confronted with literature on alcohol research from anthropology, sociology, history, biology, medicine, psychology, and public health and asked to think through the conflicts and contradictions. Selected case studies will be used to focus the discussion of broader theoretical concepts and competing perspectives introduced in the first part of the course. Topics for lectures and discussion include: What is alcohol? chemical definition, cultural forms, production processes, biological effects; The early history of alcohol: archaeological studies; Histories of drinking in ancient, medieval, and modern times; Alcohol and the political economy: trade, politics, regulation, resistance; Alcohol as a cultural artifact: the social roles of drinking; Styles of drinking and intoxication; Alcohol, addiction, and social problems: the interplay of biology, culture, and society; Alcohol and religion: integration vs. prohibition; Alcohol and health benefits: ancient beliefs and modern scientific research; Comparative case studies of drinking: ethnographic examples, historical examples, contemporary America (including student drinking).</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

<span>Study of the history and culture of baseball can raise in a new light a wide range of basic questions in social theory. The world of sports is one of the paradoxical parts of cultural history, intensely intellectually scrutinized and elaborately “covered” by media, yet largely absent from scholarly curricula. Perhaps more than any other sport, baseball has even drawn a wide range of scholars to publish popular books about it, yet has produced few professional scholars whose careers are shaped by study of it. In this course, we will examine studies that connect the cultural history of baseball to race, nation, and decolonization, to commodity fetishism and the development of capitalist institutions, to globalization and production of locality. We will compare studies of baseball from a range of disciplinary perspectives (economics, evolutionary biology, political science, history, and anthropology) and will give special attention to the culture and history of baseball in Chicago. We hope and expect that this course will be a meeting ground for people who know a lot about baseball and want to learn more about cultural anthropology, and people who are well read in anthropology or social theory who want to know more about baseball. The course will draw heavily on the rich library of books and articles about baseball, scholarly and otherwise, and will also invite students to pursue their own research topics in baseball culture and history.</span></p><p class="courseblockdetail">

The modern period was associated with industrial production, class society, rationalization, disenchantment, the welfare state, and the belief in salvation by society. Current societies are characterized by a culture of consumption; consumption is central to lifestyles and identity, it is instantiated in our technological reality and the complex of advertising media, structures of wanting and shopping. Starting from the question “why do we want things” we will discuss theories and empirical studies that focus on consumption and identity formation; on shopping and the consumption of symbolic signs; on consumption as linked to the re-enchantment of modernity; as a process of distinction and of the globalization of frames; and as related to time and information. The course is built around approaches that complement the “productionist” focus of the social sciences.

This course provides a broad overview of South Asian archaeology and early history, from the beginnings of agricultural production to the expansion of states and empires in the early days of textual records. We cover critical anthropological processes such as the origins and expansion of agriculture, the development of one of the world's first urban societies—the Harappan or Indus civilization—the growth and institutionalization of social inequalities, and changing contexts of social and religious life. While the course actually extends a bit beyond the time of the Buddha, its major focus is on the periods up to and including the Early Historic.

 How has the study of past material cultures contributed to our comprehension of the Iberian colonial experience in the New World? How has an archaeology of the recent past been presented to the public and made socially relevant in contemporary Latin American nations? This course invites students to address these questions in the light of current Latin American thought, and to gain innovative perspectives on the different processes through which archaeological knowledge participates in the formation and transformation of cultural, social, and racial identities in present-day Latin America. Exploring a wide array of scholarly literature, principally produced in countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico, this course will provide a detailed insight into the achievements, limitations, possibilities, and future challenges of Latin American historical archaeology. During the semester, students will be familiarized with some of the main topics that have been approached in Latin America through a strategic interplay of material data and written texts. These topics range from the study of cultural contact in early colonial settlements to the development of forensic archaeology as a therapeutic instrument facilitating the remembrance of a traumatic past. Class discussions will also delve into rich archaeological evidence testifying to the development of specific social spaces and categories, such as maroons, colonial borderlands, or gentrified households in republican urban centers. The careful analysis of each one of these highly varied topics, as described in local archaeological literature, shall eventually contribute to a better understanding of the way in which the politics of cultural heritage can be played out in different areas of Latin America.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

<p class="courseblocktitle"><strong>ANTH&#160;26325.  Archaeologies of Slavery in the New World.  100 Units.</strong></p><p class="courseblockdesc">
In the last few decades, the archaeology of slavery has passed from being a virtually non-existing  field of inquiry to being recognized as one of the most dynamic and fastest growing areas in archaeological research. In particular, at least since the late 1960s, the study of enslaved African American communities in what came to be the United States has become one of the most visible and socially relevant avenues of research in contemporary historical archaeology. Following this essentially North American impulse, archaeologies of slavery in modern times have started to emerge throughout the Atlantic world and Latin America, inspiring richly textured narratives through which many Afro-descendant communities have had the possibility to build intimate and empowering connections with their own past. This course will look into both classic and current literature on the anthropology of slavery in order to set the basis for a critical understanding of the development of the archaeology of slavery in the New World. Students are invited to discover a wide array of case studies describing different aspects of social life in slave societies, from an initial focus on the living conditions on plantation sites to later interests in the processes of consolidation of Afro-descendant identities in Latin America. Moving beyond stereotypical discussions of dominance and resistance, this course will motivate students to read between the lines of archaeological praxis, identifying both the achievements and the current challenges faced by those investigating the problem of slavery in the recent past. Ultimately, the goal of this course is to highlight the role of archaeology as a potent instrument of remembrance of traumatic pasts: How, by whom, and for whom is the painful experience of enslavement remembered in the present?</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

Agriculture is, fundamentally, a human manipulation of the environment, a deliberately maintained successional state designed to serve human needs and desires. In this course, we use the history of non-industrial agriculture to think through some contemporary concerns about environmental change and the sources of our food—including topics such as genetically modified plants, fertilizers, sustainability, and invasive species. Beginning with the origins of agriculture in the early Holocene, we examine several forms of so-called "traditional" agriculture in the tropics and elsewhere, from swidden to intensive cropping. While the course is framed in terms of contemporary concerns, our focus is primarily historical and ethnographic, focusing on the experiences of agriculturalists over the last ten thousand years, including non-industrial farmers today.

How does language create our sense of time, and our conviction that there is/are pasts, presents, and futures? How are quite different forms of time (in conjunction with space) constructed by language ideologies and enacted in familiar and exotic interactional events? National time and memory, narrative time, historical time, romantic time, diagetic time, diasporic time, global time, institutional time, and many others—have all been proposed and discussed in recent ethnographies. They all require mediation by linguistic or broadly semiotic form and action. The class will start with some theoretical discussion of semiotic tools for analyzing temporality and then read a series of recent ethnographies that take up these issues in depth.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

The United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction defines disaster in three crucial terms: hazards, vulnerability, and capacity. While only the first of these can be "natural’"in the way that that term is commonly understood, catastrophic events and processes are frequently represented as exogenous, autonomous, and unpredictable elements of a bio-physical world. Beginning from the theorization of disaster as a property of nature, this seminar examines the political ecology of drought, flood, earthquake, and famine in their historical, economic, and cultural contexts, focusing on community vulnerability and capacity as outcomes of socio-natural histories and relations. Drawing on historical and contemporary case studies, we will consider a number of dimensions of the dynamic between nature, dislocation, and communities in an increasingly vulnerable world.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

Is death a universal and natural condition? Is life necessarily its opposite? Anthropologists have sought to problematize the biological and psychological ‘reality’ of death by drawing out the conditional ways death is constructed and experienced across different cultural contexts. These range from ‘normal’ deaths to the unconventional (e.g. sorcery killings and human sacrifice) and even virtual deaths. How might these culturally specific accounts be open to comparison and influence new conceptualizations? This course will explore this wide-ranging literature to foreground how death puts self, personhood, and the <em>social</em> into question while engaging the body or corpse as a site of this cultural (re)production. A focus of the course is to seek out a possible productive tension between death as a form of cultural representation to those that analyze the making and allowing of life and death. Tracing classic to recent ethnographic, archaeological, psychological writings, this course will explore themes such as grief and mourning, the undead, immortality, disposals and funerals, and the materiality of dying.</p><p class="courseblockdetail">

<p class="courseblocktitle"><strong>ANTH&#160;28510.  Anthropology of Space/Place/Landscape.  100 Units.</strong></p><p class="courseblockdesc">
<span>Materiality has emerged as a fertile interest in anthropology and other social sciences. Within this broad conceptual umbrella, space, place, and landscape have become critical lenses for analyzing and interpreting people’s engagement with their physical surroundings. Once an inert backdrop to social life, a mere epiphenomenon, the material world is now acknowledged as a generative medium and terrain of cultural production: at once socially produced and framing sociality, shaping and constraining human possibilities, both by and against design. This course concerns itself with these articulations: (1) the spatial production of social worlds, (2) its expressions in different cultural and historical settings, and (3) its trails of ambiguous effects. Drawing on several fields, anthropology and geography chiefly, but also art history, architecture, philosophy, and social theory, we will explore how the triad of space/place/landscape works on, in, and through different social worlds and its role in the making of social experience, perception, and imagination. We will also reflect on how spatial formations frequently elude the very social projects that have birthed them. The objective of the course is to provide you with a foundation in contemporary spatial thought, which can be creatively applied to questions of spatiality in your own research setting.</span></p><p class="courseblockdetail">

<span>This seminar examines how archaeologists have approached political life in the past forty years. Its aim is to question the categories through which political worlds are often studied (beginning with such unwieldy terms as 'states,’ 'chiefdoms,’ ‘complexity,’ etc.) and complicate analyses of politics in the past. Rather than relying on concepts that already predetermine the outcome of political functioning, we will read key texts in anthropology and political theory (on sovereignty, domination, legitimacy, political economy, governance, ideology, hegemony, subjectivity, anarchy) to dissect the foundations and operations of power, expose its cultural logics, and explore the processes behind the categories. Some of the questions that will guide our discussions include: How do politics work in both past and present? Through what channels and modalities? With what effects (anticipated or not)? And what role does the material world play in mediating these relations? Each week will pair theoretical readings with case-studies drawn from different parts of the world and from different moments in history. Through this seminar, students will gain familiarity with classic archaeological thinking on power and critical perspectives steering contemporary studies of past politics.</span></p><p class="courseblockdetail">

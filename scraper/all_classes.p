V\u000aThis course is an intensive examination of the origins, structure, and meaning of two native states of the ancient Americas: the Inka and the Aztec. Lectures are framed around an examination of theories of state genesis, function, and transformation, with special reference to the economic, institutional, and symbolic bases of indigenous state development. This course is broadly comparative in perspective and considers the structural significance of institutional features that are either common to or unique expressions of these two Native American states.

Against the backdrop of an enduring geopolitics and geoeconomics of petroleum, coal, and nuclear power, of transnational activist and governmental discourse on sustainability, and of local concerns about resource entitlement and cultural sovereignty, we examine how clean energy forms are being imagined, developed, institutionalized, and contested in a variety of places across the world. In each case, we explore the unique social life of an emergent technology and source of power.

V\u000aSince its inception as an academically institutionalized discipline, anthropology has always addressed the relation between a self-consciously modernizing West and its various and changing others. Yet it has not always done so with sufficient critical attention to its own concepts and categories\u2014a fact that has led, since at least the 1980s, to considerable debate about the nature of the anthropological enterprise and its epistemological foundations. This course provides a brief critical introduction to the history of anthropological thought over the course of the discipline's long twentieth century, form the 1880s to the present. Although we focus on the North American and British traditions, we review important strains of French and, to a lesser extent, German social theory in chronicling the emergence and transformation of modern anthropology as an empirically based, but theoretically informed, practice of knowledge production about human sociality and culture.

We stress a variety of traditional theoretical concerns of the broader Mesoamerican region stressed (e.g., the validity of reconstructive ethnography; theories of agrarian community structure; religious revitalization movements; the constitution of such identity categories as indigenous, Mayan, and Yucatecan). In this respect, the course can serve as a general introduction to the anthropology of the region. The relevance of these area patterns for general anthropological debates about the nature of culture, history, identity, and social change are considered.

V\u000aContemporary China is often spoken of as undergoing deep and rapid social change. Certainly globalizing forces have been especially evident in all parts of China over the last couple of decades. At the same time, like the rest of East Asia and the Pacific Rim, China has developed distinctive social, cultural, and political forms, many of which circulate nationally and transnationally. This course comes to terms with both the processes of change that have characterized the last few decades and with a few recent social and cultural phenomena of interest. Because the scholarly literature lags behind the pace of transformation in China, we draw on a wide variety of materials: ethnography, memoir, fiction, films, essays, historical studies, short stories, websites. Emphasis in class discussions is on grasping how contemporary Chinese realities are experienced from viewpoints within China\u2014this is the sense in which the course is intensive study of a "culture." Readings and materials are divided into several major units concerned with historical memory, rural China, urban life, labor migration, and popular culture. Students undertake, as a term project, their own investigation of some aspect of contemporary cultural change in China.

Each week we tackle one of these topics, paring a classic anthropological work with specific examples from the historical, archaeological, and/or ethnographic literature.

V\u000aCelts and things Celtic have long occupied a prominent and protean place in the popular imagination, and "the Celts" has been an amazingly versatile concept in the politics of identity and collective memory in recent history. This course is an anthropological exploration of this phenomenon that examines: (1) the use of the ancient past in the construction of modern nationalist mythologies of Celtic identity (e.g., in France and Ireland) and regional movements of resistance to nationalist and colonialist project (e.g., in Brittany, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Gallicia, Asturias); (2) the construction of transnational ethno-nostalgic forms of Celtic identity in modern diasporic communities (Irish, Scottish, etc.); and (3) various recent spiritualist visions of Celticity that decouple the concept from ethnic understandings (e.g., in the New Age and Neo-Pagan movements). All of these are treated in the context of what is known archaeologically about the ancient peoples of Europe who serve as a symbolic reservoir for modern Celtic identities. The course explores these competing Celtic imaginaries in the spaces and media where they are constructed and performed, ranging from museums and monuments, to neo-druid organizations, Celtic cyberspace, Celtic festivals, Celtic theme parks, Celtic music, Celtic commodities, etc.

V\u000aIn the first part of the course we look at how post\u2013World War II mass communications and \u201cclassical\u201d film theory theorized communication and spectatorship; in particular, we trace the dialogue between these liberatory models and the totalitarianism and propaganda (i.e., top-down models of control) of the times. We then look at theories of mass media reception and spectatorship that put ideology at the center of their analysis, interrogating theories of the \u201creceiver\u201d of media messages as cultural dope (Frankfurt school Marxism), psychoanalytic and (post-)Marxist theories of spectatorship (\u201cScreen\u201d theory), feminist critiques of film spectatorship, and reactions to the above in cognitivist film studies. We then turn to British Cultural Studies\u2019 theories of media, focusing on how such work attempts to reconcile models of reception as ideologically unproblematic and as determined by the ideological structures of production and reception. Particular focus is given to the theoretical arguments regarding ideology and media, the notion of \u201ccode,\u201d and the differences and similarities in the model of communication with the sociology of mass communication. In the second half of the course we look at anthropological approaches to media and how anthropologists have taken up the issue of media reception. Why have anthropologists largely ignored media and reception studies until recently? What kinds of contributions can anthropology make to the theorization and methodological approach to reception? By critically looking at ethnographies of reception, we problematize the concept of reception proper, looking at more holistic ways of dealing with the issue of the mediation of social life. In the final part of the course we re-evaluate what we mean by \u201cmass media\u201d and \u201creception.\u201d First we look media (con)texts that blur the duality of production/reception. We then consider new forms of media and to what extent \u201creception\u201d as a category even makes sense in attempting to understand how engagement with such new media functions.

V\u000aDepending on how you look at it, questions of indigeneity\u2014the who, how, what, and why of peoples that either identify, or are identified, as \u201cnative\u201d\u2014are questions that at once transcend, entail, and/or are produced by Euro-American scholarly, political, and legal inquiry. Whether assailed as the product of colonial orientalism or celebrated as the ur-subjectivity of those who resist it (or something in between), the claims of, to, and about indigeneity continue to excite and demand attention scholarly and political. Indeed some argue that politics of indigeneity have gained unique traction in recent decades, as indigenous actors, scholars, and their advocates have pressed for changes to legal, political, and cultural/scientific regimes that have indigenous affairs as their chief objects of inquiry. One need only consider the 2007 passage of the UN Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the legal decisions acknowledging the force of native title in the Supreme Courts of Australia and Canada, and even the changes in various regimes of research concerning the social scientific study of native peoples and/or the representation of their material culture, all of which happened less than 20 years ago. Despite these long-standing interests and recent social, politica,l and economic gains, indigenous communities remain among the most vulnerable in the world. These trenchant inequalities beg the question, how does the condition of indigeneity relate to the various social forces shaping the world today and to the lived experiences of those who claim to be, or get named as, indigenous. It is towards an exploration of this question that this course is dedicated. Among the lines of inquiry that we will pursue in the course are: (1) tracing the genealogies of indigeneity as a notion, both in Euro-American human sciences and in other epistemological traditions; (2) considering the role that notions of indigeneity play in contemporary national and international political regimes; (3) exploring how indigeneity is claimed or disclaimed, by different peoples around the world, and why; and (4) considering the ways in which notions of indigeneity are being figured in new regimes of possession and commodification, including intellectual property, genetics and genome mapping, and the role of indigenous knowledge in resource extraction and bioprospecting. In pursuing these questions this course will endeavor to tease out the manifold relationships that the rising politics of indigeneity at the dawn of the 21st century has to other global political economic phenomena. Simultaneously, the course will also attend to the ways in which different peoples, caught up in different sociopolitical milieu, orient to the notion of indigeneity as it articulates with their lived experiences with matters of autochthony (the state of being \u201cfrom here\u201d), allochthony (being \u201cfrom elsewhere\u201d), and the consequences of those distinctions to their everyday lives.

V\u000a The 1969 publication of Vine Deloria Jr.\u2019s Custer Died for your Sins forever changed the landscape for academic research with indigenous communities in North America, if not the world. Declaring, \u201cIndians have been cursed above all other peoples in history. Indians have anthropologists.\u201d(Deloria 1988[1969]: 78), Deloria\u2019s broadside was aimed at a social science academy whose research methods, ethics, and findings he felt offered little concrete benefit to the indigenous peoples whose lives they studied. Whether accurate or not, the critique sent ripples not only through the academy, but through policy circles and the native communities themselves, inaugurating a period of remarkable refiguring of the legal, scholarly, and interpersonal landscapes against which social science research on indigenous peoples is constituted. This refiguring has emerged in a variety of modes and with different effects and outcomes. In this course, students will be introduced to the evolving ethics, methods, policies, and epistemologies shaping social science research with indigenous communities in North America. In addition, in the second half of the quarter, students will get firsthand experience working on issues of relevance to social science research with indigenous communities under the supervision of Prof. Richland and leadership at two institutions in Chicago\u2014the Title VII American Indian Education Program and the North American Anthropology Division of the Field Museum. In this part of the course, students will be paired up and work on independent projects that are designed to address the needs and interests of these organizations and the indigenous peoples with which they work, and then to initiate their own academic inquiry alongside those projects. These projects will provide you with an opportunity to understand and implement the theories, ethics, and methods learned in class, revealing the rewards and challenges of conducting research programs that engage leading theories and debates in the academy while also making real contributions to the indigenous communities with which students are working.

Finished, monological utterances? Conditions of possibility? Strait gates through time? Weber, Bakhtin, and Benjamin provide insights and analytical tools of unsurpassed power. Scholars who use them best have faced and made key decisions about social ontology and social science epistemology, decisions that follow from specific, radical propositions about society and social science made by these theorists and others they engage, starting at least from Immanuel Kant. This course is designed for any student who wants to more clearly understand the arguments of Weber, Bakhtin, and Benjamin, and to understand more broadly the remarkable trajectories of German social theory after Kant. It is designed especially for anyone hoping to use some of their conceptions well in new research. (Yes, Bakhtin is Russian, and cultural theory in Russia and the U.S. too will come up.) Fair warning: this course focuses on four roads out of Kant\u2019s liberal apriorism (including culture theory from Herder to Boas and Benedict, as well as Benjamin and the dialectical tradition, Bakhtin\u2019s dialogism, and Weber\u2019s historical realism). We will spend less time on good examples of current use of Weber\u2019s, Bakhtin\u2019s, and Benjamin\u2019s ideas than on the writings of Weber, Bakhtin, and Benjamin themselves, and their predecessors and interlocutors (including Herder, Hegel, Clausewitz, Marx, Ihering, and Simmel). The premise of the course is that you will do more in your own research with a roadmap than with templates.

V\u000aThe rise of modern biological medicine into global dominance dates from the 18th century, with the field developing in tandem with technological industrialization, scientific objectivism, and secular modernism in writing and social theory. The things we now have before us in the medical field\u2014doctors, patients, drugs, symptoms, diseases, pacemakers, antiseptic wipes, psychologies, therapeutic protocols, health insurance, white coats, immunizations, folk remedies, and much more\u2014are many of the things that ground all of our ethics and our politics in contemporary North America. In order to better understand how medicine affects wider worlds of experience and action, this course gathers a number of historical and ethnographic studies of medical knowledge and practice for careful study. In a series of readings and discussions we will consider the social and political economic shaping of illness and suffering and the \u201cculture-bound\u201d character of diseases; we will examine medical and healing systems\u2014well beyond biomedicine\u2014as social institutions and as sources of epistemological authority; and we will read about the knowledge politics of medical experts and their clients and patients. Topics covered will also include the problem of belief; local theories of disease causation and healing efficacy; the placebo effect and contextual healing; theories of embodiment; medicalization; modernity and the distribution of risk; the meanings and effects of medical technologies; and the relatively recent global health movement.

On a conceptual level, the course will invite students to think through the complex relationships between categories of knowledge and clinical technologies (in this case, mainly psychiatric ones) and the subjectivities of persons living with mental illness. Put in slightly different terms, we will look at the multiple links between psychiatrists' professional accounts of mental illness and patients' experiences of it. Readings will be drawn primarily from medical and psychological anthropology, cultural psychiatry, and science studies, but will include some "primary texts" from the memoiristic and psychiatric literatures.

V\u000aThere is a substantial portion of the psychological nature of human beings that is neither homogeneous nor fixed across time and space. At the heart of the discipline of cultural psychology is the tenet of psychological pluralism, which states that the study of "normal" psychology is the study of multiple psychologies and not just the study of a single or uniform fundamental psychology for all peoples of the world. Research findings in cultural psychology thus raise provocative questions about the integrity and value of alternative forms of subjectivity across cultural groups. In this course we analyze the concept of "culture" and examine ethnic and cross-cultural variations in mental functioning with special attention to the cultural psychology of emotions, self, moral judgment, categorization, and reasoning.

Furthermore, this course reads classic and contemporary ethnographies of magic together with studies of science and technology to critically examine questions of agency, practice, experience, experiment, and efficacy. The course reads widely across sites, disciplines, and theories, attending to eventful objects and alien agents, stepping into post-socialist, post-colonial, and post-secular magic markets and medical clinics, and reading for the political energies of the emergent communities that effectively mix science, magic, and technology.

V\u000aAlcohol is the most widely used psychoactive agent in the world, and, as archaeologists have recently demonstrated, it has a very long history dating back at least 9,000 years. This course will explore the issue of alcohol and drinking from a trans-disciplinary perspective. It will be co-taught by an anthropologist/archaeologist with experience in alcohol research and a neurobiologist who has experience with addiction research. Students will be confronted with literature on alcohol research from anthropology, sociology, history, biology, medicine, psychology, and public health and asked to think through the conflicts and contradictions. Selected case studies will be used to focus the discussion of broader theoretical concepts and competing perspectives introduced in the first part of the course. Topics for lectures and discussion include: What is alcohol? chemical definition, cultural forms, production processes, biological effects; The early history of alcohol: archaeological studies; Histories of drinking in ancient, medieval, and modern times; Alcohol and the political economy: trade, politics, regulation, resistance; Alcohol as a cultural artifact: the social roles of drinking; Styles of drinking and intoxication; Alcohol, addiction, and social problems: the interplay of biology, culture, and society; Alcohol and religion: integration vs. prohibition; Alcohol and health benefits: ancient beliefs and modern scientific research; Comparative case studies of drinking: ethnographic examples, historical examples, contemporary America (including student drinking).

V\u000aStudy of the history and culture of baseball can raise in a new light a wide range of basic questions in social theory. The world of sports is one of the paradoxical parts of cultural history, intensely intellectually scrutinized and elaborately \u201ccovered\u201d by media, yet largely absent from scholarly curricula. Perhaps more than any other sport, baseball has even drawn a wide range of scholars to publish popular books about it, yet has produced few professional scholars whose careers are shaped by study of it. In this course, we will examine studies that connect the cultural history of baseball to race, nation, and decolonization, to commodity fetishism and the development of capitalist institutions, to globalization and production of locality. We will compare studies of baseball from a range of disciplinary perspectives (economics, evolutionary biology, political science, history, and anthropology) and will give special attention to the culture and history of baseball in Chicago. We hope and expect that this course will be a meeting ground for people who know a lot about baseball and want to learn more about cultural anthropology, and people who are well read in anthropology or social theory who want to know more about baseball. The course will draw heavily on the rich library of books and articles about baseball, scholarly and otherwise, and will also invite students to pursue their own research topics in baseball culture and history.

V\u000aThe modern period was associated with industrial production, class society, rationalization, disenchantment, the welfare state, and the belief in salvation by society. Current societies are characterized by a culture of consumption; consumption is central to lifestyles and identity, it is instantiated in our technological reality and the complex of advertising media, structures of wanting and shopping. Starting from the question \u201cwhy do we want things\u201d we will discuss theories and empirical studies that focus on consumption and identity formation; on shopping and the consumption of symbolic signs; on consumption as linked to the re-enchantment of modernity; as a process of distinction and of the globalization of frames; and as related to time and information. The course is built around approaches that complement the \u201cproductionist\u201d focus of the social sciences.

V\u000aSouth Asia has a rich historical record, from the very beginnings of our species to the present, and yet the earlier part of this record is surprisingly little-known outside specialist circles. This course provides a broad overview of South Asian archaeology and early history, from the beginnings of agricultural production to the expansion of states and empires in the early days of textual records. We cover critical anthropological processes such as the origins and expansion of agriculture, the development of one of the world's first urban societies\u2014the Harappan or Indus civilization\u2014the growth and institutionalization of social inequalities, and changing contexts of social and religious life. While the course actually extends a bit beyond the time of the Buddha, its major focus is on the periods up to and including the Early Historic. No prior experience of either South Asia or archaeology is assumed; Indeed, we will think quite a bit about the nature of evidence and about how we know about the more distant past.

Texts and discussions address topics such as the archaeology of colonialism, capitalism, industrialization, and mass consumption. Case studies from plantation archaeology, urban archaeology, and international contexts anchor the discussion, as does a consideration of interdisciplinary methods using texts, artifacts, and oral history. Our goal is to understand the historical trajectory of this peculiar archaeological practice, as well as its contemporary horizon.

V\u000a How has the study of past material cultures contributed to our comprehension of the Iberian colonial experience in the New World? How has an archaeology of the recent past been presented to the public and made socially relevant in contemporary Latin American nations? This course invites students to address these questions in the light of current Latin American thought, and to gain innovative perspectives on the different processes through which archaeological knowledge participates in the formation and transformation of cultural, social, and racial identities in present-day Latin America. Exploring a wide array of scholarly literature, principally produced in countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico, this course will provide a detailed insight into the achievements, limitations, possibilities, and future challenges of Latin American historical archaeology. During the semester, students will be familiarized with some of the main topics that have been approached in Latin America through a strategic interplay of material data and written texts. These topics range from the study of cultural contact in early colonial settlements to the development of forensic archaeology as a therapeutic instrument facilitating the remembrance of a traumatic past. Class discussions will also delve into rich archaeological evidence testifying to the development of specific social spaces and categories, such as maroons, colonial borderlands, or gentrified households in republican urban centers. The careful analysis of each one of these highly varied topics, as described in local archaeological literature, shall eventually contribute to a better understanding of the way in which the politics of cultural heritage can be played out in different areas of Latin America.

On Spanish colonial sites, these evidences of long-distance exchange often merged with local material cultures, entering processes of hybridization and creolization that can be observed in the archaeological record. This course proposes an archaeologically based approach to typical assemblages of Spanish colonial artifacts in the Americas and the Caribbean, and describes the main issues related to their identification, interpretation, conservation, and display.

V\u000aIn the last few decades, the archaeology of slavery has passed from being a virtually non-existing  field of inquiry to being recognized as one of the most dynamic and fastest growing areas in archaeological research. In particular, at least since the late 1960s, the study of enslaved African American communities in what came to be the United States has become one of the most visible and socially relevant avenues of research in contemporary historical archaeology. Following this essentially North American impulse, archaeologies of slavery in modern times have started to emerge throughout the Atlantic world and Latin America, inspiring richly textured narratives through which many Afro-descendant communities have had the possibility to build intimate and empowering connections with their own past. This course will look into both classic and current literature on the anthropology of slavery in order to set the basis for a critical understanding of the development of the archaeology of slavery in the New World. Students are invited to discover a wide array of case studies describing different aspects of social life in slave societies, from an initial focus on the living conditions on plantation sites to later interests in the processes of consolidation of Afro-descendant identities in Latin America. Moving beyond stereotypical discussions of dominance and resistance, this course will motivate students to read between the lines of archaeological praxis, identifying both the achievements and the current challenges faced by those investigating the problem of slavery in the recent past. Ultimately, the goal of this course is to highlight the role of archaeology as a potent instrument of remembrance of traumatic pasts: How, by whom, and for whom is the painful experience of enslavement remembered in the present?

In this course, we use the history of non-industrial agriculture to think through some contemporary concerns about environmental change and the sources of our food\u2014including topics such as genetically modified plants, fertilizers, sustainability, and invasive species. Beginning with the origins of agriculture in the early Holocene, we examine several forms of so-called "traditional" agriculture in the tropics and elsewhere, from swidden to intensive cropping. While the course is framed in terms of contemporary concerns, our focus is primarily historical and ethnographic, focusing on the experiences of agriculturalists over the last ten thousand years, including non-industrial farmers today.

National time and memory, narrative time, historical time, romantic time, diagetic time, diasporic time, global time, institutional time, and many others\u2014have all been proposed and discussed in recent ethnographies. They all require mediation by linguistic or broadly semiotic form and action. The class will start with some theoretical discussion of semiotic tools for analyzing temporality and then read a series of recent ethnographies that take up these issues in depth.

V\u000aThe United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction defines disaster in three crucial terms: hazards, vulnerability, and capacity. While only the first of these can be "natural\u2019"in the way that that term is commonly understood, catastrophic events and processes are frequently represented as exogenous, autonomous, and unpredictable elements of a bio-physical world. Beginning from the theorization of disaster as a property of nature, this seminar examines the political ecology of drought, flood, earthquake, and famine in their historical, economic, and cultural contexts, focusing on community vulnerability and capacity as outcomes of socio-natural histories and relations. Drawing on historical and contemporary case studies, we will consider a number of dimensions of the dynamic between nature, dislocation, and communities in an increasingly vulnerable world.

V\u000aIs death a universal and natural condition? Is life necessarily its opposite? Anthropologists have sought to problematize the biological and psychological \u2018reality\u2019 of death by drawing out the conditional ways death is constructed and experienced across different cultural contexts. These range from \u2018normal\u2019 deaths to the unconventional (e.g. sorcery killings and human sacrifice) and even virtual deaths. How might these culturally specific accounts be open to comparison and influence new conceptualizations? This course will explore this wide-ranging literature to foreground how death puts self, personhood, and the social into question while engaging the body or corpse as a site of this cultural (re)production. A focus of the course is to seek out a possible productive tension between death as a form of cultural representation to those that analyze the making and allowing of life and death. Tracing classic to recent ethnographic, archaeological, psychological writings, this course will explore themes such as grief and mourning, the undead, immortality, disposals and funerals, and the materiality of dying.

V\u000aMateriality has emerged as a fertile interest in anthropology and other social sciences. Within this broad conceptual umbrella, space, place, and landscape have become critical lenses for analyzing and interpreting people\u2019s engagement with their physical surroundings. Once an inert backdrop to social life, a mere epiphenomenon, the material world is now acknowledged as a generative medium and terrain of cultural production: at once socially produced and framing sociality, shaping and constraining human possibilities, both by and against design. This course concerns itself with these articulations: (1) the spatial production of social worlds, (2) its expressions in different cultural and historical settings, and (3) its trails of ambiguous effects. Drawing on several fields, anthropology and geography chiefly, but also art history, architecture, philosophy, and social theory, we will explore how the triad of space/place/landscape works on, in, and through different social worlds and its role in the making of social experience, perception, and imagination. We will also reflect on how spatial formations frequently elude the very social projects that have birthed them. The objective of the course is to provide you with a foundation in contemporary spatial thought, which can be creatively applied to questions of spatiality in your own research setting.

V\u000aThis seminar examines how archaeologists have approached political life in the past forty years. Its aim is to question the categories through which political worlds are often studied (beginning with such unwieldy terms as 'states,\u2019 'chiefdoms,\u2019 \u2018complexity,\u2019 etc.) and complicate analyses of politics in the past. Rather than relying on concepts that already predetermine the outcome of political functioning, we will read key texts in anthropology and political theory (on sovereignty, domination, legitimacy, political economy, governance, ideology, hegemony, subjectivity, anarchy) to dissect the foundations and operations of power, expose its cultural logics, and explore the processes behind the categories. Some of the questions that will guide our discussions include: How do politics work in both past and present? Through what channels and modalities? With what effects (anticipated or not)? And what role does the material world play in mediating these relations? Each week will pair theoretical readings with case-studies drawn from different parts of the world and from different moments in history. Through this seminar, students will gain familiarity with classic archaeological thinking on power and critical perspectives steering contemporary studies of past politics.

V\u000aThis introductory course surveys the major patrons, architects, and building programs that defined the spatial contexts of the Renaissance in Italy. Between the 15th and 16th centuries, the political aspirations of governments, popes, princes, and merchants demanded a more articulated architectural environment that would facilitate increasingly complex modes of public and private life. They were aided in this endeavor by the emergence of a newly professionalized class of architects, who turned their eyes towards both a systematic study of the classical past and a critical assessment of their contemporary world. Renaissance urban palaces\u2014both civic and private\u2014and rural villas provided the stages upon which a new art of living could be performed. New inventions in military engineering responded to rapidly advancing technologies of warfare. Urban planning techniques created new topographies of spiritual and political triumph and reform, while treatises on ideal cities laid the foundations for the modern integrated multi-functional city. Between Venice, Florence, Rome, and their rural surroundings, this course will focus on a range of important patrons such as Roman popes, Venetian doges, princely courts, and private merchants, and will explore what made the works of such architects as Filippo Brunelleschi, Giuliano da Sangallo, Leon Battista Alberti, Francesco di Giorgio, Michelangelo, Jacopo Sansovino, and Andrea Palladio so creative, innovative, and influential well into our own contemporary architectural landscape.

V\u000aDuring the Middle Ages, icons\u2014sacred images\u2014played a pivotal role in the devotional practice of Byzantium, the eastern Christian empire that had its capital in Constantinople from 324 to 1453. \u201cWindows to heaven,\u201d sacred images provided access to the divine. Despite their spiritual function, icons also drew attention to their materiality by erupting into life\u2014bleeding, weeping, and attacking foes. In this course, we will combine the study of Byzantine images with Byzantine primary sources (in translation) to explore a range of topics related to the icon, including medieval image theory, iconoclasm, visuality, enshrinement, the copy, and materiality. Our investigation of Byzantine images will be enhanced through comparison with responses to the image in Islam, Judaism, and the Christian west.

By focusing on these urban gathering sites, this course explores a range of key historical moments in which different formations of the city square emerge (political, communal, royal, imperial, colonial, modernist, privatized, etc.). Its goal is to define a set of criteria for analyzing what constitutes a city square, how \u201cpublic space\u201d also has a history, how public monuments function over time, and how understanding the urban environment is always dependent on the intimate relationship between physical structures and spatial performances. It will consider, therefore, both the design morphology and the social configurations that infuse such spaces with meaning in any given context.

By examining one architect's work in context, students gain experience analyzing buildings and their siting, and interpreting them in light of their complex ingredients and circumstances.

V\u000aThe central focus of this course will be Michelangelo\u2019s prolific production in sculpture, painting, and architecture while making substantial use of his writings, both poetry and letters, and his extensive extant body of preparatory drawings to help us understand more about his artistic personality, creative processes, theories of art, and his intellectual and spiritual biography, including his changing attitudes towards Neoplatonism, Christianity, and politics. Our structure will be roughly chronological starting with his highly precocious juvenilia of the 1490s in Florence at the court of Lorenzo the Magnificent through his death in Rome in 1564 as an old man who was simultaneously already the deity of art and a lonely, troubled, repentant Christian, producing some of his most moving works in a highly personal style. Beyond close examination of the works themselves, among the themes that will receive considerable attention for the ways they bear upon his art are Michelangelo\u2019s fraught relationship with patrons such as the Medici and a succession of popes; his complex devotion to and rivalry with ancient classical art and his living rivalry with Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Bramante, and others; his changing attitude towards religion, especially his engagement with the Catholic Reform and some of its key personalities such as Vittoria Colonna; his sexuality and how it might bear on the representation of gender in his art and poetry; his \u201cofficial\u201d biographies created by the devotees Giorgio Vasari (1550, 1568) and Ascanio Condivii (1553) during Michelangelo\u2019s lifetime and some of the most influential moments in the artist\u2019s complex, sometimes ambivalent, reception over the centuries; new approaches and ideas about Michelangelo that have emerged in recent decades from the unabated torrent of scholarship and, especially, the restoration and scientific imaging of many of his works. Through the concentrated art-historical material studied, the course will take seriously the attempt to introduce students with little or no background in art or art history to some of the major avenues for interpretation in this field, including formal, stylistic, iconographical, psychological, social, feminist, theoretical, and reception. Readings are chosen with this diversity of approach in mind.

V\u000aThis course addresses the foundations of humanist drawing in early modern Europe from the perspectives of disegno, as the conceptual and formal \u201cfoundation" of art, and from the critical art historical junctures in which drawing achieves both an intellectual and an autonomous status. By looking at the works of such important artists as Michelangelo, Leonardo, the Carracci, Rubens, and Watteau, drawing will be analyzed in the context of its increasingly central place in the creative process, as a place of intellectual freedom, as a study tool to explore the past and the natural world, and as an autonomous work of art. By examining early \u201cmoments\u201d of the humanist practice of drawing and artistic training from the standpoints of theory, practice, content, and the art market, this course aims to further problematize the nature, evolution, and stakes of early modern drawing as a cognitive and aesthetic process, and, by extension, the relationship between drawing and other more \u201cfinished\u201d works such as painting. Students will gain familiarity with drawing as an artistic medium related to major questions about art and society.

V\u000aIn the remote, but omnipresent past of classical antiquity, what kinds of experiences and practices fell under the umbrella of terms and concepts that we moderns call \u201cgender\u201d and \u201csexuality\u201d? This course explores the fundamentally visual aspect of this question by drawing attention first and foremost to works of Roman art, but also to topics such as the erotics of vision, the senses of shame and modesty, and bodily comportment. While the robust corpus of ancient and modern literature on these topics will constitute an important part of our discussions, we will likewise consider the ways in which ancient art provides forms of evidence that are analogous, but never coextensive, with that of ancient texts. Finally, taking a cue from Tom Stoppard\u2019s play The Invention of Love (1997), in which A. E. Housman declares that the \u201cbarbarity\u201d of homosexuality is that it\u2019s \u201chalf Greek and half Latin,\u201d we will attend to the ways in which the dynamics of gender and sexuality took shape in a historical continuum in which the lines between what was \u201cGreek\u201d and what was \u201cRoman\u201d became increasingly blurred.

V\u000aThough they did not compose a \u201cmulti-cultural society\u201d in the modern sense, the ruling elite and subjects of the vast Ottoman Empire came from a wide variety of regional, ethnic, linguistic, and religious backgrounds. The dynamics of the Empire\u2019s internal cultural diversity, as well as of its external relations with contemporary courts in Iran, Italy, and elsewhere, were continuously negotiated and renegotiated in its art and architecture. This course examines classical Ottoman architecture, arts of the book, ceramics, and textiles. Particular attention is paid to the urban transformation of Byzantine Constantinople into Ottoman Istanbul after 1453, and to the political, technical, and economic factors leading to the formation of a distinctively Ottoman visual idiom disseminated through multiple media in the sixteenth century.

V\u000aThe easing of political life and the relaxation of private morals which came to characterize the long reign of Louis XV (1715\u20131774) was mirrored by the development of a new conception of art, an art more intimate, decorative, generally amorous, and often erotic. It is these last two related dimensions which are the basis of a new visual aesthetic which constitutes the subject matter of this course. Through the exploration of contemporary novels and theater, as well as contemporary critical and philosophical writings, we will demonstrate how both the sensual and the erotic become essential components of the century\u2019s cultural ethos. Artistic subjects, the mechanisms to represent them, their metaphorical stakes, and their phenomenological effects on the beholder will therefore be considered as the expression of a particular historical and ideological context. It is in this context that love became the symbol of a king who privileged peace against war, and where emotional pleasure triumphed over moralizing values and asserted itself as a new aesthetic category.

It is not designed to be a survey course, but rather a historical investigation of certain issues and developments. We will concentrate on the following:  what has been said to happen to objects when they are uprooted and moved into the museum; how and why museums have changed display practices so as to get viewers to look at art in new ways; what artists have understood museums to represent and how they have responded to that understanding in their work and their display preferences. Though reference will be made to the contemporary art world, the focus will be on materials and case studies drawn from the French Revolution through the 1960s. French, German, English and American museums will be featured.

This experimental period generated theoretical writing that continues to matter to architects today; we will study it in terms of its initial contexts and application. Major themes are: (1) the relationship of a building\u2019s structure to its decoration (or body to clothing, as it was sometimes put); (2) the rise of historical interest in older buildings from divergent stylistic traditions (e.g., classical and Gothic) and its impact on new design; (3) the development of aesthetic theory suited to mass as well as elite audiences (e.g., the sublime and the picturesque); and (4) the idea that architect and building could and should be ethical or socially reformative.

Students read essays that have shaped and represent the discipline, and test their wider applicability and limitations. Through this process, they develop a keener sense of the kinds of questions that most interest them in the history and criticism of art and visual culture. Students develop a formal topic proposal in a brief essay, and write a final paper analyzing one or two works of relevant, significant scholarship for their topics. This seminar is followed by a workshop in Autumn Quarter focusing on research and writing issues for fourth-year students who are majoring in art history, which is designed to help writers of BA papers advance their projects.

The study of pharmacogenomics is complicated by the fact that response and toxicity are multigenic traits and are often confounded by nongenetic factors (e.g., age, co-morbidities, drug-drug interactions, environment, diet). Using knowledge of an individual's DNA sequence as an integral determinant of drug therapy has not yet become standard clinical practice; however, several genetics-guided recommendations for physicians have been developed and are highlighted. The ethics and economics of pharmacogenomics are also discussed.

We sharply focus the immunologic knowledge from BIOS 25256 onto the biologic barriers to organ acceptance and the ultimate goal of immunologic tolerance. We also address principles of organ preservation and the mechanisms of ischemia/reperfusion injury. The technical aspects and physiology of organ transplantation (i.e., kidney, liver, heart, lung, pancreas, islet, intestinal) are covered. The social, economic, and ethical issues raised in transplantation (i.e., allografts, xenografts, living donation) are also discussed. This course is offered in alternate years.

The course lectures and readings will provide a rigorous examination of the interactions among pathogens, hosts and the environment that produce disease in diverse populations. In addition to the demographic characteristics and the behaviors of individuals that are associated with a high risk of infection, we will examine complex aspects of the environment as they pertain to disease transmission. These include poverty, globalization, social networks, public health, and racial and ethnic disparities. Methodologic approaches to infectious disease epidemiology that will be covered include traditional study designs, molecular epidemiology, social network analysis, modeling, and network science. Local and global approaches will be applied to case studies from the United States, Asia, and Africa.

Students learn about biological databases, algorithms for sequence alignment, phylogenetic tree building, and systems biology. They will also learn about the basics of large-scale study of proteins, particularly their structures and functions. Students will be introduced to basics of high performance computation (HPC) and its application to the field of bioinformatics. They will learn how to use our in-house Super Computer to process and analyze next generation sequencing data. Using state of the art tools, students will align and genotype a group of genes in order to identify disease-relevant variants. The course will be taught as a hands on computer approach (a computation background would be helpful, but not needed).

It begins with a review of one-variable ordinary differential equations as models for biological processes changing with time, and proceeds to develop basic dynamical systems theory. Analytic skills include stability analysis, phase portraits, limit cycles, and bifurcations. Linear algebra concepts are introduced and developed, and Fourier methods are applied to data analysis. The methods are applied to diverse areas of biology, such as ecology, neuroscience, regulatory networks, and molecular structure. The students learn computations methods to implement the models in MATLAB.

V\u000aAlcohol is the most widely used psychoactive agent in the world, and, as archaeologists have recently demonstrated, it has a very long history dating back at least 9,000 years. This course will explore the issue of alcohol and drinking from a trans-disciplinary perspective. It will be co-taught by an anthropologist/archaeologist with experience in alcohol research and a neurobiologist who has experience with addiction research. Students will be confronted with literature on alcohol research from anthropology, sociology, history, biology, medicine, psychology, and public health and asked to think through the conflicts and contradictions. Selected case studies will be used to focus the discussion of broader theoretical concepts and competing perspectives introduced in the first part of the course. Topics for lectures and discussion include: What is alcohol? chemical definition, cultural forms, production processes, biological effects; The early history of alcohol: archaeological studies; Histories of drinking in ancient, medieval, and modern times; Alcohol and the political economy: trade, politics, regulation, resistance; Alcohol as a cultural artifact: the social roles of drinking; Styles of drinking and intoxication; Alcohol, addiction, and social problems: the interplay of biology, culture, and society; Alcohol and religion: integration vs. prohibition; Alcohol and health benefits: ancient beliefs and modern scientific research; Comparative case studies of drinking: ethnographic examples, historical examples, contemporary America (including student drinking).

Developmental psychopathology is a field that lies at the interface of clinical and developmental psychology within which the aim is to identify the earliest deviations from normative developmental processes that likely lead to the development of psychopathology. By incorporating the study of basic biological and psychological processes into the study of psychopathology, the identification of earliest markers, and ultimately causal factors, may be achieved.

We discuss what genome sequences have to teach us about the relatedness of living organisms, the diversity of cellular life, mechanisms of genome change over evolutionary time, and the nature of key events in the history of life on earth. The scientific issues are related to the history of evolutionary thought and current public controversies about evolution.

V\u000aThe problem of evil remains a central problem for monotheistic religions: How can an omnipotent and benevolent God allow evil in the world? Disease represents an important \u201ctest case\u201d for this question. Some argue that disease should not be called evil and would reserve this word for moral ills. Others argue that disease is a dysfunction of nature and therefore represents evil par excellence. In this course, we examine a variety of texts treating the question of disease as a philosophical issue and exemplar of the problem of evil. The texts include Scripture (Job) and selections from the writings of Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas, Feodor Dostoevsky, Albert Camus, and Thomas Mann.

Public health services in many countries find themselves at a loss in dealing with these outbreaks of disease, a deficiency to which NGOs emerge as a response (an imperfect one to be sure). Through a series of readings in anthropology, sociology, ethics, medicine, and political science, we will attempt to reach an understanding of this crisis of both epidemiological technique and state legitimacy, and to sketch out options.

V\u000aThe past two decades have witnessed a remarkable rise in the number of investigations published on the social brain. The discoveries conveyed by the titles of many of these reports (e.g., the neural basis of love, altruism, morality, generosity, trust) have piqued the interest of young investigators, funding agencies, the media, and laypeople alike. Such attention is a double-edged sword, however, as errors are exaggerated in importance, and oversimplifications create false expectations and, ultimately, disillusionment in what the field can contribute. It is, of course, one thing to assume that neural processes underlie all psychological phenomenon, it is another to claim that a given brain region is the biological instantiation of complex psychological functions like the self, empathy or loneliness. The purpose of this course is to examine opportunities and challenges in this field primarily through research on two of the most important topics in the field: social isolation and empathy.

V\u000aWhat constitutes radicalism in cinema? All too often the expression radical has been reserved for films that come under the rubric of \u201cart\u201d, \u201cparallel\u201d or \u201cthird\u201d cinema. Formally these films share certain commonalities with Latin American, Eastern European cinemas and even the various European new waves. Is it possible however to read a radical politics and ethics into films and filmmakers who did not self-consciously describe themselves as such? To what extent does political cinema and extra-cinematic discussions of such films compromise questions of formalism? This course will analyze these and related issues by looking closely at Indian cinema from 1947 to 1977. We will be watching and discussing both \u201cpopular\u201d and \u201cart\u201d films to understand the ways in which they have addressed (or not) issues of mass politics, the state, and the people.

V\u000aMedia ecology examines how the structure and content of our media environments\u2014online and offline, in words, images, sounds, and textures\u2014affect human perception, understanding, feeling, and value; or alternatively, media ecology investigates the massive and dynamic interrelation of processes and objects, beings and things, patterns and matter. At stake are issues about agency\u2014human or material\u2014and about determinism\u2014how does society or culture interact with or shape its technologies, or vice versa? This course investigates theories of media ecology by exploring systems of meanings that humans embody (cultural, social, ecological) in conjunction with the emerging field of software studies about the cultural, political, social, and aesthetic impacts of software (e.g., code, interaction, interface). In our actual and virtual environments, how do we understand performing our multiple human embodiments in relation to other bodies (organism or machine) in pursuit of social or political goals?

V\u000aEastern Europe has menaced the "enlightened" West for centuries. It remains to this day a valuable source for negotiating the West\u2019s phantasies. One need only look at the rich and varied story of the vampire through popular culture from the 18th-century revenant to the 21st-century sex symbol and family man to confirm this fascination. Eastern Europe (and I use this term here to conform to popular discourse) is the West\u2019s necessary construct to enforce the ideation of its own health and weal. In this course, contemporary horror film produced both within and without Eastern Europe\u2014and at times in partnership with the \u201cWest\u201d\u2014but all with the East as haunt, landscape, and affect are discussed with the West\u2019s and East\u2019s anxieties (social, political, artistic) in mind. Films include Eli Roth\u2019s Hostel franchise, Julie Delpy\u2019s The Countess, Timur Bekmambetov\u2019s Night Watch and Day Watch, Pavel Ruminov\u2019s Dead Daughters, Nacho Cerdà\u2019s The Abandoned, György Palfi\u2019s Taxidermia, and the highly controversial A Serbian Film directed by Sr\u0111an Spasojevi\u0107. Readings range from work on defining the horror genre to philosophies of anxiety to critical interrogations of specific films. This class contains films with scenes that ought to be disturbing.

We will watch his major feature films and shorts with an eye to the relationship between cinematic form and technology. Although we will not neglect Disney's place in global culture, our focus will be on developing a vocabulary for analyzing the visual style of celluloid animation and learning to conduct primary research in the history of film production and reception. Readings will draw equally from criticism by Disney's contemporaries and recent works of historical and theoretical scholarship on animation in general and Disney in particular.

V\u000aThis course will present a critical survey of the principal authors, concepts, and films in the classical period of film theory. The main though not exclusive emphasis will be the period of silent film and theorists writing in the context of French and German cinema. We will study the aesthetic debates of the period in their historical context, whose central questions include: Is film an art? If so, what specific and autonomous means of expression define it as an aesthetic medium? What defines the social force and function of cinema as a mass art? Weekly readings and discussion will examine major film movements of the classical period\u2014for example, French impressionism and Surrealism\u2014as well as the work of such major figures as Hugo Münsterberg, Rudolf Arnheim, Jean Epstein, Germaine Dulac, Béla Balázs, Erwin Panofsky, Hans Richter, Siegfried Kracauer, Walter Benjamin, and André Bazin.

In what ways can the image be considered a sign? How do images come to have meaning in a denotative or connotative sense? What are the principal codes organizing images as narrative media and how do spectators recognise those codes? Readings will include work by Roland Barthes, Christian Metz, Jean Mitry, Noël Burch, Raymond Bellour, Umberto Eco, Pier Paolo Pasolini, and David Bordwell, among others.

They also begin to establish criteria for artistic expression. We investigate photography in relation to its historical and social context in order to more consciously engage the photograph's communicative and expressive possibilities.

This course will look at how these media work: the history of their development, the changes they have brought about in a broader media culture, their political implications, and their social status and significance (e.g., the place they occupy in culture, the kinds of interactions they make possible). The focus will equally be on the ways in which cinema has responded to the changing digital landscape, which will be explored through both blockbuster and experimental films as well as video and web-based art. Readings will be taken from the history of film theory, recent work in media history and archeology, and theoretical studies of digital media and technology.

How does music of different styles and provenance contribute to the semiotic universe of film? And how did film music assume a central voice in twentieth-century culture? We study music composed for films (original scores) as well as pre-existent music (e.g., popular and classical music). The twenty films covered in the course may include classical Hollywood cinema, documentaries, foreign (e.g., non-Western) films, experimental films, musicals, and cartoons.

While a conventional historical account would map the tensions between absorption and distanciation as a one-way trip, moving from absorption (in Wagner) to distanciation (as coined by Brecht) to distraction (as deployed by Kluge), we will explore how each artist deploys each term to varying effects. Works to be considered include Wagner's The Flying Dutchman and Parsifal, Brecht's Man Is Man and The Measures Taken, and Kluge's Yesterday Girl and The Power of Emotions. Readings by each artist, as well as by Theodor Adorno, Walter Benjamin, Michael Fried, Miriam Hansen, Andreas Huyssen, and Gertrud Koch. In English.

V\u000aIn the 1940\u2019s the American avant garde cinema gained a new identity with the work of filmmakers like Maya Deren and Kenneth Anger. Working primarily in 16mm, exhibiting mainly in non-commercial theaters, pursuing new models of sexuality, perception and political action, a generation of filmmakers formulated an alternative cinema culture and a new visionary aesthetic. This tradition gained further definition in the following, with journals, new critical discourses and a network of exhibition. Film modes moved through the mythic and dream-like cinema of Stan Brakhage and Bruce Baillie, the underground cinema of Ken Jacobs, Andy Warhol, and Jack Smith, and the structural films of Hollis Frampton, Michael Snow, and Ernie Gehr. The course will trace these developments and examine their legacy.

V\u000aThe advances science has produced have transformed life beyond anything that a person living in 1833 (when the term "scientist" was first coined) could have anticipated. Yet science continues to pose questions that are challenging and, in some instances, troubling. How will our technologies affect the environment? Should we prevent the cloning of humans? Can we devise a politically acceptable framework for the patenting of life? Such questions make it vitally important that we try to understand what science is and how it works, even if we never enter labs. This course uses evidence from controversies (e.g., Human Genome Project, International Space Station) to throw light on the enterprise of science itself.

I will devote particular attention to the mutual construction of archaeological interpretation and Israeli identity and to the contested role of archaeology in the public sphere both within Israeli society and in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

The course\u2019s aim is to use messianism as a focal point around which to consider the dynamic relationship between philosophy and Jewish civilization. It will examine the changing representations of the the Messiah within the history of Jewish civilization. Concurrently it will consider the after-effect of these representations on discourses of modernity and vice-versa, illustrating both how Enlightenment conceptions of progress helped to create the notion of \u201cmessianism\u201d understood as an abstract idea, and how the modern/post-modern philosophical conception of the \u201cmessianic\u201d as a force that interrupts time is dependent upon historical studies of the messianic dimension of traditional Judaism.

We will explore the history of the state since its establishment, its intellectual elites, their cultural production, as well as the protests, demonstrations, and sit-ins organized by Israeli Jews in Israel during the years 1948-2012. The class will reflect on tensions between Israelis of different origins, Mizrahi, Ashkenazi and Ethiopian communities in particular, and will discuss whether the arrival of various communities of Jews to Israel signified a liberating exodus from an oppressive  exile; we will therefore consider different periodizations of Israeli history in which the moment of arrival to Israel of various migrants/\u2019olim (like Holocaust survivors, Mizrahi Jews, and others) marked the beginning of a difficult journey, aimed at achieving social mobility and citizenship rights in the Jewish state. We will also look at conflicts based on religion, especially the encounters between Haredi, national-religious and secular Jews in Israel. Finally, we will explore Israel\u2019s relations with its Palestinian citizens and the Palestinian subjects in the occupied West Bank. The class will consider instances of politicized violence in Israel, and reflect on the ways in which their analysis could inform our thinking about social identities, nationalism, and religiosity. We will try to read against, and beyond, national Zionist narratives; unpack many national silences regarding the social and economic tensions embodied in these events, and study their implications with respect to visions of pluralism, binationalism, integration, and nationalism in Israel.

V\u000aThe Hebrew Bible is the most important intertextual point of reference in Modern Hebrew literature, a literary tradition that begins with the (sometimes contested) claim to revive the ancient language of the Bible. In this course, we will consider the Bible as a source of vocabulary, figurative language, voice and narrative models in modern Hebrew and Jewish literature, considering the stakes and the implications of such intertextual engagement. Among the topics we will focus on: the concept of language-revival, the figure of the prophet-poet, revisions and counter-versions of key Biblical stories (including the story of creation, the binding of Isaac and the stories of King David), the Song of Songs in Modern Jewish poetry.

We likewise explore the ways in which archeologists, historians, novelists, and artists emphasized the connectivity between past and present, and the channels through which their new ideas were transmitted. The class thus highlights phenomena like nationalism, reform, and literary and print capitalism (in both Hebrew and Arabic) as experienced in the Middle East.

V\u000aIn the remote, but omnipresent past of classical antiquity, what kinds of experiences and practices fell under the umbrella of terms and concepts that we moderns call \u201cgender\u201d and \u201csexuality\u201d? This course explores the fundamentally visual aspect of this question by drawing attention first and foremost to works of Roman art, but also to topics such as the erotics of vision, the senses of shame and modesty, and bodily comportment. While the robust corpus of ancient and modern literature on these topics will constitute an important part of our discussions, we will likewise consider the ways in which ancient art provides forms of evidence that are analogous, but never coextensive, with that of ancient texts. Finally, taking a cue from Tom Stoppard\u2019s play The Invention of Love (1997), in which A. E. Housman declares that the \u201cbarbarity\u201d of homosexuality is that it\u2019s \u201chalf Greek and half Latin,\u201d we will attend to the ways in which the dynamics of gender and sexuality took shape in a historical continuum in which the lines between what was \u201cGreek\u201d and what was \u201cRoman\u201d became increasingly blurred.

They will see the emergence of distinctive forms of sculpture, architecture, pottery, and urban design\u2014many of which are still in use today.

V\u000aRoman religion is very rarely accorded a place of prominence in the history of religions of Late Antiquity or the modern academic study of religion. Too often when Roman religion is acknowledged it is as part of a more general picture of Greco-Roman paganism\u2019s decline in the wake of Christianity\u2019s rise to power. The purpose of this course then is to consider how we might understand Roman religion as a discrete yet dynamic set of discourses, practices, communities, and institutions in the contexts of both the late antique religious world and the modern academic study of religion. To this end, this course will introduce students not only to the basic elements of Roman religious life, but also to the dominant scholarly models used to engage the ancient sources. Finally, at a more theoretical level, this course also will challenge students to think critically about how religion as a modern analytic category may or may not be useful in understanding ancient cultures.

Particular attention will be given to Roman attitudes towards labor, the ethical issues surrounding buying and selling, and alternative allocative mechanisms to the market. Of constant concern will be the tension between the perspectives and prejudices of elites, which stand behind so much surviving literary evidence, and the realities of everyday commerce and economic life as they can be glimpsed in the archaeological and epigraphic record.

Along the way, the course will also provide an introduction to the diversity and uniformity of the Roman Empire.

The course will draw on literary and documentary sources as well as archaeology and remnants of material culture. The topics that will be covered include not only the practicalities of death (funerary rituals, legal aspects of death like wills and inheritance), but also beliefs and myths of the afterlife, magical rituals such as necromancy, the impact of Christianization on Roman understandings of death, and later Christian developments like the cult of the saints.

V\u000aThis seminar is designed to teach students the research and writing skills necessary for writing their BA paper. Lectures cover classical bibliography, research tools, and electronic databases. Students discuss research problems and compose preliminary drafts of their BA papers. They are expected to exchange criticism and ideas in regular seminar meetings with the preceptor and with other students who are writing papers, as well as to take account of comments from their faculty readers. The grade for the BA Paper Seminar is identical to the grade for the BA paper and, therefore, is not reported until the BA paper has been submitted in Spring Quarter. The grade for the BA paper depends on participation in the seminar as well as on the quality of the paper. Students may register for this seminar in either Autumn or Winter Quarter, but they are expected to participate in meetings throughout both quarters.

Yet Isocrates has not found nearly so prominent a place in the university curriculum as have Demosthenes and Lysias. This course will attempt to give the great orator his due. We will start with his speech on Helen, comparing it with Gorgias' famous Encomium. We will also read the ad Demonicum, which became something of a handbook in later Hellenistic and Roman-period schools, and the Panegyricus. We will consider carefully Isocratean language and diction, and why it has merited such sustained praise among connoisseurs of Greek prose style, ancient and modern.

All statistical concepts and methods will be illustrated with application studies in which we will consider the research questions, study design, analytical choices, validity of inferences, and reports of findings. The examples include (1) examining the relationship between home environment and child development and (2) evaluating the effectiveness of class size reduction for promoting student learning. At the end of the course, students should be able to define and use the descriptive and inferential statistics taught in this course to analyze data and to interpret the analytical results.

The course provides an introduction to the history of linguistic anthropology and to the differences between \u201cstructuralist\u201d and \u201cpost-structuralist\u201d understandings of language. It concludes with an extended consideration of hate speech: what it is, what is does and how it might best be contested.

V\u000aTwenty-first century practices of relevance to education, social services, health care and public policy deserve buttressing by cultural and context linked perspectives about human development as experienced by diverse groups. Although generally unacknowledged as such post-Brown v. 1954, the conditions purported to support human development for diverse citizens remain problematic. The consequent interpretative shortcomings serve to increase human vulnerability. Specifically, given the problem of evident unacknowledged privilege for some as well as the insufficient access to resources experienced by others, the dilemma skews our interpretation of behavior, design of research, choice of theory, and determination of policy and practice. The course is based upon the premise that the study of human development is enhanced by examining the experiences of diverse groups, without one group standing as the \u201cstandard\u201d against which others are compared and evaluated. Accordingly, the course provides an encompassing theoretical framework for examining the processes of human development for diverse humans while also highlighting the critical role of context and culture.

We stress a variety of traditional theoretical concerns of the broader Mesoamerican region stressed (e.g., the validity of reconstructive ethnography; theories of agrarian community structure; religious revitalization movements; the constitution of such identity categories as indigenous, Mayan, and Yucatecan). In this respect, the course can serve as a general introduction to the anthropology of the region. The relevance of these area patterns for general anthropological debates about the nature of culture, history, identity, and social change are considered.

V\u000aThe course explores the place and role of language in pornographic films. Why does language occur in filmed pornography at all? What kind of language occurs? What role does it play? How is it gendered? How does it frame the narrative or drive it forward? How does language subvert or undermine the visual representation of sex? What does any of this tell us about gender, sexuality and erotics in non-pornographic contexts? Course readings focus on theories of pornographic representation, theories of language, gender and erotics, and methods of transcribing and analyzing dialogue. The course requires students to watch a wide range of pornography, including different varieties of straight, gay and trans porn, so anyone enrolling in the course must be interested in pornography as a social and cultural phenomenon and must also have experience watching porn and thinking about it.

V\u000aThere is a substantial portion of the psychological nature of human beings that is neither homogeneous nor fixed across time and space. At the heart of the discipline of cultural psychology is the tenet of psychological pluralism, which states that the study of "normal" psychology is the study of multiple psychologies and not just the study of a single or uniform fundamental psychology for all peoples of the world. Research findings in cultural psychology thus raise provocative questions about the integrity and value of alternative forms of subjectivity across cultural groups. In this course we analyze the concept of "culture" and examine ethnic and cross-cultural variations in mental functioning with special attention to the cultural psychology of emotions, self, moral judgment, categorization, and reasoning.

On a conceptual level, the course will invite students to think through the complex relationships between categories of knowledge and clinical technologies (in this case, mainly psychiatric ones) and the subjectivities of persons living with mental illness. Put in slightly different terms, we will look at the multiple links between psychiatrists' professional accounts of mental illness and patients' experiences of it. Readings will be drawn primarily from medical and psychological anthropology, cultural psychiatry, and science studies, but will include some "primary texts" from the memoiristic and psychiatric literatures.

It approaches the problem of magic historically\u2014examining how magic became an object of social scientific inquiry\u2014and anthropologically, attending to the magic in practice on the margins of the industrial, rational, cosmopolitan, and technological societies and economies. Furthermore, this course reads classic and contemporary ethnographies of magic together with studies of science and technology to critically examine questions of agency, practice, experience, experiment, and efficacy. The course reads widely across sites, disciplines, and theories, attending to eventful objects and alien agents, stepping into post-socialist, post-colonial, and post-secular magic markets and medical clinics, and reading for the political energies of the emergent communities that effectively mix science, magic, and technology.

V\u000aThe goal of this course is to introduce students to the literature on early child development and explore how an understanding of core developmental concepts can inform social policies. This goal will be addressed through an integrated, multidisciplinary approach. The course will emphasize research on the science of early child development from the prenatal period through school entry. The central debate about the role of early experience in development will provide a unifying strand for the course. Students will be introduced to research in neuroscience, psychology, economics, sociology, and public policy as it bears on questions about \u201cwhat develops?\u201d, critical periods in development, the nature vs. nurture debate, and the ways in which environmental contexts (e.g., parents, families, peers, schools, institutions, communities) affect early development and developmental trajectories. The first part of the course will introduce students to the major disciplinary streams in the developmental sciences and the enduring and new debates and perspectives within the field. The second part will examine the multiple contexts of early development to understand which aspects of young children\u2019s environments affect their development and how those impacts arise. Throughout the course, we will explore how the principles of early childhood development can guide the design of policies and practices that enhance the healthy development of young children, particularly for those living in adverse circumstances, and thereby build a strong foundation for promoting equality of opportunity, reducing social class disparities in life outcomes, building human capital, fostering economic prosperity, and generating positive social change. In doing so, we will critically examine the evidence on whether the contexts of children\u2019s development are amenable to public policy intervention and the costs and benefits of different policy approaches.

V\u000aThe transition to adulthood has become deinstitutionalized and decontextualized to the point that those in the process of becoming adults find themselves lost, cast adrift, and wondering whether something called adulthood even exists any more. It is widely acknowledged that the transition to adulthood has become delayed and drawn out in contemporary, highly technological Western societies. What is less clear is what this change means for individuals and for the larger society. Is it good that young people have more time to decide what adulthood means to them? Does the delay represent the hardening of class boundaries and greater difficulty in establishing the economic security necessary for adulthood? What are the implications of people in their late 20's and even 30's thinking of themselves as only "soft-of" adult? How is this delay experienced differently across gender, race, and class? This course will employ a cross-disciplinary approach to explore the meaning(s) of adulthood and the reasons for the delay in the transition to adulthood. We will examine this issue from sociological, psychological, historical, and anthropological perspectives. Questions to be addressed in this course include: What do we mean by a postmodern context? How have shifts in institutional structures created changes in the meaning of adulthood? What can be learned about adulthood and maturity from a cross-cultural or historical-comparative approach? Is there anything universal about the idea of adulthood or maturity? What are the implications, both for the individual and for the larger society, when one doesn't know when, how, or whether they can become an adult?

V\u000aThis course provides an introduction to ethnographic methods used in anthropological, sociological, and other social science research. The primary goal of this course is for students to gain theoretical and practical knowledge of ethnographic methods through a combination of readings and fieldwork exercises. In doing so, students will learn about formulating research questions, participant observation, interviewing, working with images, videos, texts, and material objects, and analyzing and writing up research findings. Another goal of this course is for students to learn to use ethnographic data to develop social, cultural, and theoretical insights. In order to achieve this goal, and to provide topical and theoretical coherence to this hands-on methods course, students will focus their fieldwork exercises on sites in the Chicago area that are related to medicine, health, and the body. In class sessions, students will discuss each other\u2019s fieldwork findings and collaboratively develop ethnographically-informed knowledge about ideas and practices of medicine, health, and the body in contemporary North America.

Students will also spend significant time on developing individual research papers. We will begin in the first two weeks with an overview of the field of child psychopathology and the diagnostic systems most commonly used in the practice of child psychiatry. We will then spend the next three weeks looking at two of the most common and controversial diagnoses applied to children in the United States: Autism-spectrum disorders and Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder. In examining these categories we will consider the cultural and historical contexts that have lead to the emergence of these diagnoses and the variety of experiences of those identified as being afflicted with these disorders. The highly public controversy over giving children psychiatric medication and the implications of exporting Western psychiatric knowledge about children to other cultural contexts will also be considered. In the second half of the class we will move away from examinations of psychiatric nosology to think more broadly about the ways in which concepts of the normative treatment and behavior of children vary across time and place, looking particularly at the effects of aggression on children.

V\u000aThis course is designed to provide a comprehensive background in the study of human development across the life span by exploring the influences of culture, environment, social setting, heredity, and physiology on cognitive, emotional, and behavioral processes. Materials will cover the biological/genetic, attachment relations, social, economic, environmental, and neurobiological influences on the developing individual from prenatal development until death. The main focus will be on \u201cnormal\u201d development or group averages rather than the development of a single individual, although differences among individuals will be discussed. The primary objective of this course is for the student to gain an understanding and appreciation of human development through the lifespan via readings of theory and research, class lectures, class discussion, and films. The goal of the class is to expose students to a range of current research in the areas of development, attachment, and neurobiological and social processes across the lifespan in order to develop new ways of conceptualizing development based upon the new information available via this research.  Counts for Life Course Development area.

V\u000aThis course looks at the reception of Giambattista Vico (1668\u20131744), whose philosophy, largely neglected at first, eventually came to enjoy far-reaching influence as European thinkers set out on repeated quests for the source of a different \u201cmodernity\u201d or \u201cCounter-Enlightenment\u201d in fields as varied as political theory (Romagnosi, Cattaneo, Ferrari), the historical and modernist novel (Cuoco, Manzoni, Joyce), Romantic historiography (Michelet, Gioberti), literary criticism (Auerbach), and intellectual history (Berlin). What is the secret behind the enduring appeal of Vico\u2019s anti-rationalist stance? This seminar, going further than dedicating itself to the legacy of a single thinker, wishes to investigate the \u201clogic\u201d (or lack thereof) that attends posthumous acclaim, eponymity, and etiological myths, and to provide guidelines for a disciplined approach to the history, practice, and theory of reception.

V\u000aThe increasing urbanization of late 19th and early 20th century Europe witnessed the advent of a comparatively novel social phenomenon and cultural trope: the crowd. Crowds have been represented as alienating, faceless monstrosities and as liberatingly anonymous environments of self-realization. They are figured as manipulable but also as bullying, as hotbeds of rumor, irrationality, madness, sedition, and communicable disease, but also as sites of transcendent super-personal experience, invention, historical progress, and the groundspring of political legitimacy. Crowds have a (statistical, sociological, psychological) life of their own which confronts and contrasts with the life of the individual. They confirm the flâneur in his ironic distance and insulated subjectivity even as the phenomenology of \u201cmerging with\u201d or \u201cmelting into\u201d the crowd challenges prevailing notions of individual identity and personal responsibility. This course will examine a variety of literary and visual representations of the crowded turn-of-the-century European metropolis in conjunction with contemporaneous psychological, sociological, and philosophical reflections on the significance of modern multitudes. Though our focal texts are historical, we will also consider modulations of these themes in our own social environment of viral videos, big data, cyberbullying, crowd-sourcing, and zombie movies. We will study works by Charles Baudelaire, Walter Benjamin, Elias Canetti, Gustave Caillebotte, Sigmund Freud, Siegfried Kracauer, Fritz Lang, Édouard Manet, Robert Musil, Rainer Maria Rilke, Georges-Pierre Seurat, and Georg Simmel.

V\u000aIt is frequently said that poetry cannot be translated, or can only be translated with significant loss. Yet translations of poetry continue to appear, and the work of some poets even seems to thrive in translation. Can translation theory help us to account for this apparent paradox? This course will introduce students to classic and contemporary texts of translation theory in the West, with an eye to the relevance of these theories for the difficulties and promises of translating poetry. We will read theoretical texts by Jerome, Dryden, Herder, Schleiermacher, Nietzsche, Benjamin, Pound and others, and will test these theories against one another and against various English translations of excerpts taken from Dante's Inferno, as well as translations of individual poems from Charles Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du Mal and Petits Poèmes en prose. Students will have the opportunity to produce their own translations as part of their required work for the course.

This course will juxtapose these early 20th century models with Beckett\u2019s plays on stage and screen and those of his contemporaries (Ionesco, Genet, Duras). Contemporary texts include Vinaver, Minyana, in French, Pinter, Churchill, Kane in English. Theorists include Barthes, Badiou, Bert States, and others.

V\u000a\u201cTrue earnestness itself invents the comic,\u201d according to Søren Kierkegaard. Exploring philosophies of the comic, as well as filmic and literary material, this seminar seeks to investigate what may be called the serious core of comedy. First, some fundamental theories of comedy, humor, and laughter will be introduced. These range from perspectives of supremacy, relief, shallowness, or negligibility (especially when compared to the tragic), the mechanic, the lowly/corporeal, to theories of incongruity. We will then focus on the critical, transformative, and political potentials of the comic/comedy: ways in which comedy copes with chance and contingencies; with strategies of resistance and inversion in face of disproportionately more powerful opponents; the comic as a mode of inclusion and exclusion; comedy and its relation to freedom and to the sublime; comedy as a means to exceed, undermine, and open up boundaries; the comic as an attempt to get to grips with situations and events we cannot (fully) master. We will also discuss limits and complications of any such critical potential. Readings may include texts by S. Freud, I. Kant, G. W. F. Hegel, F. Th. Vischer, Jean Paul, Søren Kierkegaard, Mikhail Bakhtin, Henri Bergson, Judith Butler, Alenka Zupan\u010di\u010d, and others; films include works by Ernst Lubitsch and Woody Allen.

V\u000aThe Renaissance, which first and foremost flourished in Italy, founded our modern concept of the self. The way we see ourselves, the values we cherish, derive from the Renaissance. Modernity is a product of the Renaissance. This course emphasizes the importance of introspection in Renaissance culture, poetry, and philosophy. The books I have selected have a strong autobiographical element. However, they also illuminate how the Renaissance theorizes the relationship between the individual and society. We will read, in Italian, passages from major Italian texts in prose, such as Castiglione's Il cortigiano, Machiavelli's Discorsi, Campanella's Città del Sole, and poetry by Michelangelo, Monsignor della Casa, and numerous women poets, such as Veronica Franco, Vittoria Colonna, and Veronica Gambara.

V\u000aThis course is first of all a close reading of Marsilio Ficino\u2019s seminal book On Love (first Latin edition De amore 1484; Ficino\u2019s own Italian translation 1544). Ficino\u2019s philosophical masterpiece is the foundation of the Renaissance view of love from a Neo-Platonic perspective. It is impossible to overemphasize its influence on European culture. On Love is not just a radically new interpretation of Plato\u2019s Symposium. It is the book through which sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Europe read the love experience. Our course will analyze its multiple classical sources and its spiritual connotations. During our close reading of Ficino\u2019s text, we will show how European writers and philosophers appropriated specific parts of this Renaissance masterpiece. In particular, we will read extensive excerpts from some important love treatises, such as Castiglione\u2019s The Courtier (Il cortigiano), Leone Ebreo\u2019s Dialogues on Love, Tullia d\u2019Aragona\u2019s On the Infinity of Love, but also selections from a variety of European poets, such as Michelangelo\u2019s canzoniere, Maurice Scève\u2019s Délie, and Fray Luis de León\u2019s Poesía.

What is, we will ask, the relation between literary scholarship and literary creation? We will concentrate primarily, but not exclusively, on early-modern writings, employing a comparative perspective which will allow the examination of other artistic practices beyond the literary, including music and sculpture. Among the authors to be considered will be Euripides, Pascal, Mme de Sévigné, Mme Dacier, Furetière, Milton, Swift and Baudelaire. In addition, theoretic readings will be discussed to examine problems such as the coherence and identity of literary texts, the role of the author, and the status of philology and literary criticism.

Public health services in many countries find themselves at a loss in dealing with these outbreaks of disease, a deficiency to which NGOs emerge as a response (an imperfect one to be sure). Through a series of readings in anthropology, sociology, ethics, medicine, and political science, we will attempt to reach an understanding of this crisis of both epidemiological technique and state legitimacy, and to sketch out options.

We begin with La Noire de... (1966), a groundbreaking film by the "father" of African cinema, Ousmane Sembene. We compare this film to a South African film, The Magic Garden (1960), that more closely resembles African American musical film. Other films discussed in the first part of the course include anti-colonial and anti-apartheid films from Lionel Rogosin's Come Back Africa (1959) to Sarah Maldoror's Sambizanga, Ousmane Sembene's Camp de Thiaroye (1984), and Jean Marie Teno's Afrique, Je te Plumerai (1995). We then examine cinematic representations of tensions between urban and rural, traditional and modern life, and the different implications of these tensions for men and women, Western and Southern Africa, in fiction, documentary, and ethnographic film.

It will consider African American migration, community building and organizing, labor unions, policy, and legal culture. The Civil Rights Movement and the Fair Employment Movement will be critical to this course as they best highlight the strategies and patterns of black labor organizations, protests, and negotiation since emancipation.

V\u000aThe aim of this course is to examine the politics of blackness and black mobilization in historical context and across a number of countries in the Americas. The course begins with an analysis of the structural and ideological conditions that gave rise to particular kinds of expressions of black politics in countries like the United States, Cuba, Panama, Colombia, and Brazil. In this, we focus on the early part of the 20th century and analyze the very different ways black populations and African culture were incorporated into, or excluded from, nationalist projects. This laid the context for complex processes of identity formation that would both facilitate and constrain black mobilization in these countries. We then move to the second half of the 20th century where we examine the emergence of nation-based black political movements alongside a number of attempts to build a broader Pan-African movement of the Americas. In so doing, we pay special attention to the crosspollination of ideologies, strategies, and aesthetics among black activists in ways that complicate simple North to South flows of influence. Throughout the course we explore contestation between black activists over the meanings and boundaries around blackness itself, as well as the nature of their racial utopias, both within and across national contexts.

This is a history class that situates itself within a robust interdisciplinary conversation. Students can expect to engage works of autobiography and poetry, sociology, documentary photography, and political science as well as more straightforward historical analysis. By the end of the class, students should have grounding in Black Chicago's history, as well as an appreciation of how this history outlines and anticipates Black life and racial politics in the modern United States.

A principal premise of the course is that African American life and work was at the nexus of the birth of modern America, as reflected in labor and consumption, in transnational relations (especially Africa), in cultural expression (especially music and literature), and in the resistance or contestation to many of these developments. The course will focus on the Chicago World's Fair and the publication of Du Bois's Souls of Black Folk as seminal moments in the era. Our discussions will be framed by diverse primary materials, including visual and aural sources, juxtaposed with interpretations of the era by various historians. A principal goal of the course is that students gain a greater appreciation for interpreting historical processes through in-depth examination of the complex and multiple currents of an defined era\u2014a slice of time\u2014as well as skills in interpreting diverse primary sources.

V\u000aThis course surveys the history of African Americans in Chicago, from before the 20th century to the present. In referring to that history, we treat a variety of themes, including: migration and its impact, origins and effects of class stratification; relation of culture and cultural endeavor to collective consciousness, rise of institutionalized religions, facts and fictions of political empowerment, and the correspondence of Black lives and living to indices of city wellness (service, schools, safety, general civic feeling). This is a history class that situates itself within a robust interdisciplinary conversation. Students can expect to engage works of autobiography and poetry, sociology, documentary photography, and political science as well as more straightforward historical analysis. By the end of the class, students should have grounding in Black Chicago's history, as well as an appreciation of how this history outlines and anticipates Black life and racial politics in the modern United States.

V\u000aLooking through a broad interdisciplinary lens, this course examines the trajectory of Asians and Pacific Islanders in America. How did nineteenth- and early\u2013twentieth-century "sojourners" become "citizens?" What constituted the public's shift in perception of Asians from unassimilable alien to ostensible "model minority?" We interrogate not only what it means to have been and to be an Asian in America but also what role Asian Americans have played in striving for a multiracial democracy. Conscious of the tendency to homogenize all Asians in the historical imagination, the course is explicitly comparative, incorporating the diverse and disparate experiences of East, Southeast, and South Asians, as well as Pacific Islanders in America. We also investigate and compare the histories of African Americans, Native Americans, ethnic whites, Latinas/os, and Arab Americans to highlight the Asian American experience.

And not just in Highland Burma. This course compares political trajectories of societies across the arc of the Himalayan Highlands, from Burma to Afghanistan. From World War II, through decolonization and the cold war, and via many and disparate counterinsurgency campaigns, conflict and violence has marked the region, big states and small, old states and new. This course compares the recent political regimes, struggles and fortunes of Burma, Northeast India, Nepal, Tibet, and Afghanistan.

V\u000aThe history of Maoist China is usually told as a sequence of political campaigns: land and marriage reform, nationalization of industry, anti-rightist campaign, Great Leap Forward, Cultural Revolution, etc. Yet for the majority of the Chinese population, socialism was as much about material changes as about politics: about the two-story brick houses, electric lights and telephones (loushang louxia, diandeng dianhua) that the revolution had promised; about new work regimes and new consumption patterns\u2014or, to the contrary, about the absence of such change. If we want to understand what socialism meant for different groups of people, we have to look at the "new objects" of  socialist modernity, at changes in dress codes and apartment layouts, at electrification and city planning. We have to analyze workplaces and labor processes in order to understand how socialism changed the way people worked. We also have to look at the rationing of consumer goods and its effects on people's daily lives. The course has a strong comparative dimension: we will look at the literature on socialism in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, to see how Chinese socialism differed from its cousins. Another aim is methodological. How can we understand the lives of people who wrote little and were rarely written about? To which extent can we read people's life experiences out of material objects?

Issues to be explored include the configuration of urban space and its transformation over time in relation to issues of status, class, and political authority, the formation of "city person" as a form of identity, and the tensions between the real city of lived experience and the imagined city of art and literature. We will pay particular attention to two periods of transformation, the 1870s when the modernizing state made Tokyo its capital and the period of reconstruction after the devastating earthquake of 1923. Assignments include the writing of a final research paper of approximately 15\u201318 pages.

We stress a variety of traditional theoretical concerns of the broader Mesoamerican region stressed (e.g., the validity of reconstructive ethnography; theories of agrarian community structure; religious revitalization movements; the constitution of such identity categories as indigenous, Mayan, and Yucatecan). In this respect, the course can serve as a general introduction to the anthropology of the region. The relevance of these area patterns for general anthropological debates about the nature of culture, history, identity, and social change are considered.

V\u000aHow does one go from being a subject of the king to becoming a citizen? From where does one acquire the language to think of equality? In the late eighteenth century, many revolutionary Spaniards and Spanish Americans travelled throughout the Atlantic world seeking to make the philosophy of equality a reality and gain independence of the Spanish colonies. They travelled to and from Europe and Spanish America; and on to New Orleans, Charleston, Washington DC, Philadelphia, and New York. Through their voyages, these individuals would bring this new political language of rights to the places they visited, imbibing of this political philosophy by reading and through conversations and discussions. They produced, as well, a plethora of publications and writings that circulated throughout the Atlantic world. Through lecture and discussion, students in this interdisciplinary course learn of these individuals, their circuits of travel, and their desire to create a modern world. Our focus is on the communities, individuals, and texts that were published and circulated in what is today the United States. We begin with the late eighteenth century and work our way through the nineteenth century. Classes conducted in English; most texts in English.

V\u000aThe aim of this course is to examine the politics of blackness and black mobilization in historical context and across a number of countries in the Americas. The course begins with an analysis of the structural and ideological conditions that gave rise to particular kinds of expressions of black politics in countries like the United States, Cuba, Panama, Colombia, and Brazil. In this, we focus on the early part of the 20th century and analyze the very different ways black populations and African culture were incorporated into, or excluded from, nationalist projects. This laid the context for complex processes of identity formation that would both facilitate and constrain black mobilization in these countries. We then move to the second half of the 20th century where we examine the emergence of nation-based black political movements alongside a number of attempts to build a broader Pan-African movement of the Americas. In so doing, we pay special attention to the crosspollination of ideologies, strategies, and aesthetics among black activists in ways that complicate simple North to South flows of influence. Throughout the course we explore contestation between black activists over the meanings and boundaries around blackness itself, as well as the nature of their racial utopias, both within and across national contexts.

The course will focus on case studies that correspond to four key moments in the history of the region: conquest and colonization, slavery and the formation of national states in the nineteenth century, the triumph of a capitalist export economy at the turn of the twentieth, and the violent challenges posed by globalization and narcotráfico in the contemporary context. Among the issues and texts we may engage are Fray Bartolomé de las Casas and Francisco de Vitoria\u2019s sixteenth-century dispute on the right of conquest and the Brevísima relación de la destrucción de las Indias, Esteban Echevarría\u2019s El matadero, Lucio Mansilla\u2019s Una excursión a los indios ranqueles, Juan F.

V\u000aReligious beliefs and practices are assumed to be primordial, eternal, and invariable. However a closer examination reveals that Native American religions are highly dynamic and adaptive, ever reactive to internal pressure and external circumstances. Perhaps the most dramatic forms of religious change are the transformations that anthropologists recognize as nativistic or revitalization movements. These movements on one level represent conscious breaks with an immediate negative past, and they anticipate a positive future in which present sources of oppression are overcome. Many contemporary Native American movements, political and/or religious, can be understood as sharing similar dynamics to past movements. We examine classic accounts of the Ghost Dance, often considered to be the prototypical Native American religious movement; the analysis of the Handsome Lake religion among the Senecas; and other Native American religious movements.

We cover the basic approaches sociologists have employed to understand the causes and consequences of inequality in the United States, with a focus on class, race, gender, and neighborhood. We begin by briefly discussing the main theoretical perspectives on inequality, which were born of nineteenth century efforts by sociologists to understand modernization in Europe. Then, turning to contemporary American society, we examine whether different forms of inequality are persisting, increasing, or decreasing\u2014and why. Topics include culture, skills, discrimination, preferences, the family, and institutional processes, addressing both the logic behind existing theories and the evidence (or lack thereof) in support of them.

V\u000aTwenty-first century practices of relevance to education, social services, health care and public policy deserve buttressing by cultural and context linked perspectives about human development as experienced by diverse groups. Although generally unacknowledged as such post-Brown v. 1954, the conditions purported to support human development for diverse citizens remain problematic. The consequent interpretative shortcomings serve to increase human vulnerability. Specifically, given the problem of evident unacknowledged privilege for some as well as the insufficient access to resources experienced by others, the dilemma skews our interpretation of behavior, design of research, choice of theory, and determination of policy and practice. The course is based upon the premise that the study of human development is enhanced by examining the experiences of diverse groups, without one group standing as the \u201cstandard\u201d against which others are compared and evaluated. Accordingly, the course provides an encompassing theoretical framework for examining the processes of human development for diverse humans while also highlighting the critical role of context and culture.

But what is literary history a history of? Master works? The development of national literatures? The coming to voice of subordinated groups? The evolution, emergence, and obsolescence of genres? Or perhaps an account of the effect of broader socioeconomic forces on literary production? Does literary history have a theory? And what is the relation of literary history to practical criticism? As we consider these questions we will pay particular attention to 20th-century African American literature. Students will be expected to give an in-class presentation and to write two 10-page essays or one 20-page essay.

Public policies intended to maintain and strengthen traditional racial relationships have included forced relocation, apartheid, extermination, walls, institutionalization, incarceration, segregation, ethnic cleansing, and legislated discrimination. Public policies intended to upset such traditions have included forced busing, affirmative action, the reservation of opportunities and political positions for specific castes/religions/ethnicities, and the legislated illegality of discrimination in housing and employment. Most recently in the United States, through distraction, hopelessness, indifference, neglect, the absence of good ideas, and/or the inability of advocates to compete effectively in the policy landscape, public policy has little to say about race. Even an African American president has declined to offer policy initiatives in this area. This course will examine public policy attempts to address issues of race, explore why so many seem to contain the seeds of their own failure, and formulate potential race policies that could jump start the contemporary policy conversation in this area. The course will include a research component exploring the current status of race policy in Chicago and Hyde Park.

We will trace the relationship between baseball and American society from the development of the game in the mid-nineteenth century to its enormous popularity in the first half of the twentieth century to its more recent problems and declining status in our culture. The focus will be on baseball as a professional sport, with more attention devoted to the early history of the game than to the recent era. Emphasis will be on using baseball as a historical lens through which we will analyze the development of American society rather than on the celebration of individuals or teams. Crucial elements of racialization, ethnicity, class, gender, nationalism, sexuality, and masculinity will be in play, as we consider the Negro Leagues, women's leagues, internment-era baseball, the Latinization and globalization of the game, and more.

It discusses the emergence of a modern \u201chuman rights\u201d culture as a product of the formation and expansion of the system of nation-states and the concurrent rise of value-driven social mobilizations. It proceeds to discuss human rights in two prevailing modalities. First, it explores rights as protection of the body and personhood and the modern, Western notion of individualism. Second, it inquires into rights as they affect groups (e.g., ethnicities and, potentially, transnational corporations) or states.

The late nineteenth and twentieth centuries witnessed the phenomenal growth of cities across the globe. As women and men created urban spaces, societies debated how sexual mores were to be experienced, regulated, and spatialized. The course explores urbanization in this historical moment as intersecting with colonialism, the expansion of capitalism, and decolonization. Topics to be explored include: miscegenation and race; prostitution; marriage and the law; labor and class; the body, sexual, and reproductive health; and homosexuality. Materials will include theoretical and empirical texts, fiction, legislation and court records, newspaper articles, and visual sources. Course readings encompass social, cultural, economic, and legal history. Students will produce an original research paper based on course themes.

We cover the basic approaches sociologists have employed to understand the causes and consequences of inequality in the United States, with a focus on class, race, gender, and neighborhood. We begin by briefly discussing the main theoretical perspectives on inequality, which were born of nineteenth century efforts by sociologists to understand modernization in Europe. Then, turning to contemporary American society, we examine whether different forms of inequality are persisting, increasing, or decreasing\u2014and why. Topics include culture, skills, discrimination, preferences, the family, and institutional processes, addressing both the logic behind existing theories and the evidence (or lack thereof) in support of them.

V\u000aThe specific level of vulnerability may vary across the life course; nevertheless, all humans are vulnerable and, thus, unavoidably possess both risks and protective factors. The level and character of human vulnerability matters and has implications for physical health, psychological well being, the character of culture, and mental health status. The balance between the two (i.e., risks and protective factors) can be influenced by ethnic group membership and identifiability (e.g., skin color). The cultural contexts where growth and development take place play a significant role in life course human development. As a globally admired cultural context with a particular national identity, one of America\u2019s foundational tenets is that citizenship promises the privilege of freedom, allows access to social benefits, and holds sacred the defense of rights. Our centuries-old cultural context and national identity as a liberty-guaranteeing democracy also presents challenges. The implied identity frequently makes it difficult to acknowledge that the depth of experience and its determinative nature may be but skin deep.  In America, there continues to be an uneasiness and palpable personal discomfort whenever discussions concerning ethnic diversity, race, color and the Constitutional promise and actual practice of equal opportunity occur. Other nations are populated with vulnerable humans, as well, and experience parallel dissonance concerning the social tolerance of human diversity.\u000a,Given the shared status of human vulnerability, the course unpacks and analyzes how differences in ethnicity, skin color and other indicators of group membership impact vulnerability and opportunity for diverse groups. Specifically, the course analyzes the balance between risk level and protective factor presence and examines the consequent physical health status, psychological well-being, and mental health outcomes for its dissimilar citizens. The course especially emphasizes the American cultural context but, in addition, highlights the unique experiences of ethnically varied individuals developing in multiple cultural contexts around the globe.

Instead, C is developed as a part of a larger programming toolkit that includes the shell (specifically ksh), shell programming, and standard Unix utilities (including awk). Nonshell scripting languages, in particular perl and python, are introduced, as well as interpreter (#!) files that use the command-line version of DrScheme. We cover various standard data structures, both abstractly, and in terms of concrete implementations\u2014primarily in C, but also from time to time in other contexts like scheme and ksh. The course uses a team programming approach. There is a mixture of individual programming assignments that focus on current lecture material, together with team programming assignments that can be tackled using any Unix technology. Team projects are assessed based on correctness, elegance, and quality of documentation. We teach the "Unix way" of breaking a complex computational problem into smaller pieces, most or all of which can be solved using pre-existing, well-debugged, and documented components, and then composed in a variety of ways.

Beginning in the late eighteenth century with the flowering of revivalist and individualist trends and the explosion of creativity in the woodblock prints of Hokusai and others, we will then turn to examine Western-style architecture and painting in the late nineteenth century; socialism, art criticism, and the emergence of the avant garde in the early twentieth century. Also covered are interwar architectural modernism, art during World War II, and postwar movements such as Gutai and Mono-ha. No familiarity with art history or Japan is required.

Emphasis is on artistic options and the exercise of choice within the context of social, political, religious, and economic forces. Students are expected to gain skills in formal analysis through looking with reading, and a critical perspective on the processes of art historical placement and interpretation based on assigned readings in secondary literature.

V\u000aThe dynamic interplay between painting, poetry, and calligraphy in the Chinese tradition is encapsulated by Su Shi's observation that there is "poetry in painting, and painting in poetry." Further articulation of this truism requires us to examine developing modes of visual expression, and to define ways in which a painting might be "written," or a text "imaged." We consider case studies which demonstrate increasingly fluid negotiation between these mediums: from pictures that labor in "illustrative" juxtaposition with didactic texts (image vs. word), to representations of the natural world that are inscribed with poetry as sites of social and cultural identity (image cf. word), and which achieve formal and conceptual integration in expressive purpose (imageword).

The course examines the emergence of the central power that unified feudal domains and explores processes of social, cultural, and political changes that transformed Japan into a "realm under Heaven." Some scholars consider early modern Japan as the source of an indigenous birth of capitalism, industrialism, and also of Japan\u2019s current economic vitality, while others see a bleak age of feudal oppression and isolation. We will explore both sides of the debate and examine the age of many contradictions.

V\u000aThis course covers the history of Chinese theater from its emergence as a full-fledged art form in the 10th to 11th centuries (the Northern Song) up through its incorporation into modern urban life and nationalist discourse in the first decades of the 20th century (the Republican period). In addition to reading selections from masterpieces of Chinese dramatic literature such as Orphan of Zhao, Romance of the Western Chamber, and The Peony Pavilion, we will pay particular attention to the different types of venues, occasions, and performance practices associated with different genres of opera at different moments in time. A central theme will be the changing status of the entertainer and the cultural meanings assigned to acting. All texts to be read in English translation.

We will be concerned both with the mechanics of writing itself and with its role in society. The survey will be broken into four discrete topics: the invention of writing in China, the nature of the Chinese script, the uses to which writing was put during its first thousand years in China, and early writing in Korea and Japan.

We will compare China\u2019s rival revolutionary regimes\u2014the Nationalist Guomindang and the CCP\u2014with each other and with other \u201clate modernizing\u201d regimes. What were the similarities and differences in their attempts to modernize China\u2019s economy and transform its social structures? How did they extend their power into villages, factories, and families? How did they mobilize and organize the population? We will look at GMD social policies and industrialization strategies before moving on to CCP political campaigns in the 1950s and 1960s. We will also ask how far Maoist policies after 1958 represented a break with the top-down developmentalism that characterized earlier CCP and GMD approaches.

V\u000aThe history of Maoist China is usually told as a sequence of political campaigns: land and marriage reform, nationalization of industry, anti-rightist campaign, Great Leap Forward, Cultural Revolution, etc. Yet for the majority of the Chinese population, socialism was as much about material changes as about politics: about the two-story brick houses, electric lights, and telephones (loushang louxia, diandeng dianhua) that the revolution had promised; about new work regimes and new consumption patterns\u2014or, to the contrary, about the absence of such change. If we want to understand what socialism meant for different groups of people, we have to look at the "new objects" of  socialist modernity, at changes in dress codes and apartment layouts, at electrification and city planning. We have to analyze workplaces and labor processes in order to understand how socialism changed the way people worked. We also have to look at the rationing of consumer goods and its effects on people's daily lives. The course has a strong comparative dimension: We will look at the literature on socialism in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, to see how Chinese socialism differed from its cousins. Another aim is methodological. How can we understand the lives of people who wrote little and were rarely written about? To what extent can we read people's life experiences out of material objects?

V\u000aThis course examines a selection of literary and cinematic texts that engage with the Korean War and the various political, ideological, and cultural divisions that occurred against the backdrop of the Cold War. The thematic focus of the course is placed on the family as an institution and experience, as well as the generational differences with which the war, division, and family matters were experienced. We will discuss texts with a view to exploring the formative and derivative effects of the war and its divisions upon the individual self-fashioning amidst disasters, crises, and unavoidable dilemmas. Discussion will pay special attention to the ways in which the dynamics between the trope of family, a rhetorically unifying force, and the effects of generational difference, an often divisive factor, reinforced and/or challenged the conventional ideological discourses on the Korean War and Korea\u2019s various divisions. All the film and literary texts chosen for the course have English translation/English subtitles.

V\u000aThis class provides an overview of major developments in Chinese social history from the high Qing period (roughly the eighteenth century) until very recent times. It focuses on the lives of \u201cordinary people,\u201d especially in the countryside, where over 80 percent of China\u2019s population lived until roughly 1980, and over 40 percent still live today. Topics include family organization, relations between the generations, and gender roles; property rights, class relations, and their implications for economic activity; the nature of village communities and their relationship to political/legal authority; migration, frontier settlement, and changes in ethnic and national identity; twentieth-century urbanization, consumerism, and changing notions of the individual; and collective protest, violence, and revolution. A secondary theme is more theoretical: what is it possible to know about the lives of people who left few records of their own, and how do we evaluate what are often, inevitably, thinly documented claims? The class format will include a lot of lecture, but mixed with both in-class and online discussion. No background knowledge is required.

V\u000aAs Japanese leaders in the mid-19th century faced the threat of colonization at the hands of the Western powers, they launched a project to achieve \u201cCivilization and Enlightenment,\u201d quickly transforming Japan into a global power that possessed its own empire. In the process fiction became a site for both political engagement and retreat. A civilized country, it was argued, was supposed to boast \u201cliterature\u201d as one of its Fine Arts. This literature was charged with representing the inner life of its characters, doing so in a modern national language that was supposed to be a transparent medium of communication. Between the 1880s and the early 1900s, a new language, new literary techniques, and a new set of ideologies were constructed to produce the \u201cself\u201d in novels and short stories. As soon as these new practices were developed, however, they became the objects of parody and ironic deconstruction. Reading key literary texts from the 1880s through the 1930s, as well as recent scholarship, this course will re-trace this historical and literary unfolding, paying special attention to the relationship between language and subjectivity. All readings will be in English.

V\u000aThe main focus of this course will be a careful reading of Cao Xueqin\u2019s eighteenth-century masterpiece Dream of the Red Chamber (Honglou meng). In the process, we will examine some of the range of texts, images, and issues across various literary and cultural genres in late-imperial China that this immensely complex novel draws on. The hope is that in doing so we will gain a deeper appreciation both of the novel itself and of the culture of late-imperial China. We will read about and discuss such topics as gender, erotic desire, relations between text and commentary, and the world of theater and performance, as well as dimensions of material culture and theories of medicine and illness. Adaptions of the novel into various media\u2014opera, film, and TV\u2014may also be incorporated into class discussions or occasionally screened outside class. All readings are in English, using the Penguin translation entitled The Story of the Stone. An optional section introducing selections from the original text in Chinese will be available for if there is sufficient student interest.

V\u000aAnyang, or Yinxu, the ruins of Yin, is one of the most important archaeological sites in China. The discoveries of inscribed oracle bones, the royal cemetery, clusters of palatial structures, and industrial-scale craft production precincts have all established that the site was indeed the last capital of the Shang dynasty recorded in traditional historiography. With almost continuous excavations since the late 1920s, work at Anyang has in many ways shaped and defined Chinese archaeology and the study of Early Bronze Age China.This course intends to examine the history of research, important archaeological finds, and the role of Anyang in the field of Chinese archaeology. While the emphasis is on the archaeological finds and research, this course nonetheless stresses an interdisciplinary approach by reviewing, in addition, scholarly works in art history and epigraphy. The course will also examine Anyang in the modern social and cultural contexts in terms of world heritage, national and local identity, and the looting and illicit trade of antiquities.

V\u000aThis course is designed for undergraduate and graduate students who are interested in East Asian languages and in learning or teaching East Asian languages. In this class, we will address significant issues in learning and teaching an East Asian language through key concepts in second language acquisition (SLA) and the analysis of the linguistic characteristics of Korean, Japanese, and Chinese. In particular, we will discuss the internal processes of acquisition to begin addressing the (pedagogical) issues pertinent to teaching and learning specific linguistic structures of the East Asian languages. Hence, each week, students will do readings in SLA as well as academic papers for each language on a given topic. For a comparative approach and perspective of the East Asian language and society, we will explore several linguistic and sociolinguistic issues common to the three languages that underlie the linguistic diversity and similarities of East Asia, such as the use of Chinese characters or the development and use of honorifics in China, Japan, and Korea. Such an approach will also allow us to analyze the language influence and interaction among the three languages and how that shapes the culture, society, and language use. The objectives of this course are as follows: (i) to gain a basic knowledge of the structures of East Asian Languages; (ii) to gain a basic understanding of the key theories and concepts in second language acquisition and teaching methodology; and lastly (iii) to gain new insight on East Asian history, culture, and society through the analysis of Chinese, Korean, and Japanese language.

Students should take this chance to meet fellow majors in the various areas of East Asian studies and to familiarize themselves with the work of faculty members. Third-year students should be already thinking about finding a topic and a faculty advisor for a senior thesis. Conventionally, the Concentrators Seminar is organized around a theme. The goal of this interdisciplinary seminar is to expose students to a range of important problems and methods across time and space in the study of China, Japan, and Korea. Guest lecturers and reading assigned by different University of Chicago faculty members are an integral part of the course. Students work on an individual research project tailored to their own interests, which they may subsequently develop into a BA paper.

Unlike an isolated female portrait or an individual female symbol, a feminine space is a spatial entity: an artificial world composed of landscape, vegetation, architecture, atmosphere, climate, color, fragrance, light, and sound, as well as selected human occupants and their activities.

We will consider the relationship between performance, critical theory, and the discursive production of "East Asia" as an object of study. The two main goals of the course will be (1) to introduce students to the major texts and methodological approaches of perfomance studies and (2) to consider the role performance plays in discussions of East Asian cultural production. We will consider the disciplinary formations of performance studies and East Asian studies in relation to one another as we explore theories of embodiment, perfomativity, and nationality. Students will learn different methods of reading performance closely, using documented and live performance material. Performance workshops with artists and scholars will be incorporated whenever possible. Readings will include works by such authors as Suzuki Tadashi, Rey Chow, J. L. Austin, Eve Sedgwick, Uchino Tadashi, Hijikata Tatsumi, Judith Butler, Fred Moten, Peggy Phelan, and Kandace Chuh. Students from all disciplines are welcome.

Individual objects will be examined, not only for religious, aesthetic, cultural, and historical issues, but also for what they tell us of the collections and of museum and collections studies in general. The course is also timed to coincide with the reinstallation of the museum's Chinese galleries. The course will be co-taught by Chelsea Foxwell from Art History and James Ketelaar from History, and will include methods and texts from both disciplines.

Yet although most innovations are made by individuals or small groups, until recently economists have not studied how those exceptional people produce their discoveries. Recent research has shown that there are two very different types of innovators, who have different goals and follow different processes. This course surveys this research, examining the careers and innovations of important practitioners in a range of modern arts, including painters, novelists, sculptors, poets, movie directors, photographers, songwriters, and architects, as well as entrepreneurs and scientists. The material covered in this course adds a new dimension to our understanding of creativity and of how innovators in many different activities produce new forms of art and science.

Land use, natural resource management, energy balances, and environmental impacts are all important components in the evolution of agricultural systems. Therefore it is important to develop ways in which to understand these connections in order to design effective agricultural programs and policies. This course is designed to provide students with guidance on the models and tools needed to conduct an economic research study on the intersecting topics of environment, agriculture, and food. Students learn how to develop original research ideas using a quantitative and applied economic policy analysis for professional and scholarly audiences. Students collect, synthesize, and analyze data using economic and statistical tools. Students provide outcomes and recommendations based on scholarly, objective, and policy relevant research rather than on advocacy or opinions, and produce a final professional-quality report for a workshop presentation and publication.

V\u000aFor centuries, London has served as a vibrant literary and cultural home of the African diaspora, but it has not always been very homely. This course takes its title from Samuel Selvon\u2019s seminal Lonely Londoners (1956), a novel that carefully juxtaposes the pleasures black subjects derived from participating in and contributing to British culture alongside the feelings of outrage, insecurity, and loneliness constitutive of their migratory experience. Taking our cue from Selvon, in this course we will explore the complicated ways in which black writers in London negotiated slavery, colonialism, migration, metropolitan and global racism, the post-war decline of the British Empire, and African and Caribbean independence. Readings include eighteenth-century writers such as Ignatius Sancho and Olaudah Equiano, Victorian writers such as Mary Seacole, interwar writers such as C. L. R. James and Jean Rhys, Windrush generation novelists including Selvon and George Lamming, and contemporary writers like Andrea Levy. In addition, the class will take field trips to the Black Cultural Archives in Brixton as well as to Liverpool, where we will visit the International Slavery Museum and explore the cultural traces of slavery in a city built upon the slave trade.

(In addition we will read one or two stories, and excerpts from other novels.) Our questions will revolve around the literary production of London as built space, as social space, and as a kind of medium (at once a system of communication and an atmosphere). (B, G)

Our readings and discussions will address a series of related questions: How did Britons (including major figures of British Romanticism) experience the fact of slavery in distant zones of the Empire? What were the reasons and terms motivating pro-slavery and abolitionist parties? What representational strategies did poets, novelists, lecturers, and pamphleteers adopt in describing the slave trade and plantation life? To what extent did the discourses of slavery draw from or influence contemporary notions of political and aesthetic freedom? (C, F)

In particular we will consider what it has meant to claim that the Brontes\u2019 novels have a special relationship to or claim on the psychological. What is at stake in the critical interest in subjectivity, interiority and depth in these novels? What might it mean to read these (or any) novels without or against a privileging of the psychological? We will look at significant critical movements in Victorian novel studies (ideology critique; gender theory; historicism; etc.) that have taken the Brontes\u2019 novels as their objects while we read Wuthering Heights, Jane Eyre, Shirley, Villette and other nineteenth century texts.

V\u000aThe increasing urbanization of late 19th and early 20th century Europe witnessed the advent of a comparatively novel social phenomenon and cultural trope: the crowd. Crowds have been represented as alienating, faceless monstrosities and as liberatingly anonymous environments of self-realization.  They are figured as manipulable but also as bullying, as hotbeds of rumor, irrationality, madness, sedition, and communicable disease, but also as sites of transcendent super-personal experience, invention, historical progress, and the groundspring of political legitimacy. Crowds have a (statistical, sociological, psychological) life of their own which confronts and contrasts with the life of the individual. They confirm the flâneur in his ironic distance and insulated subjectivity even as the phenomenology of \u201cmerging with\u201d or \u201cmelting into\u201d the crowd challenges prevailing notions of individual identity and personal responsibility. This class will examine a variety of literary and visual representations of the crowded turn-of-the-century European metropolis in conjunction with contemporaneous psychological, sociological, and philosophical reflections on the significance of modern multitudes. Though our focal texts are historical we will also consider modulations of these themes in our own social environment of viral videos, big data, cyberbullying, crowd-sourcing, and zombie movies. We will study works by Charles Baudelaire, Walter Benjamin, Elias Canetti, Gustave Caillebotte, Sigmund Freud, Siegfried Kracauer, Fritz Lang, Édouard Manet, Robert Musil, Rainer Maria Rilke, Georges-Pierre Seurat, and Georg Simmel.

V\u000aThis course will attempt to trace a lineage that runs from the early \u201cavant-garde\u201d of John Ruskin\u2019s social thought and aesthetic ideology all the way to the more recognized avant-garde of the Vorticist movement during the First World War. The course will strive to rupture the traditional notion that the \u201cavant-garde\u201d signifies exactly that, a rupture, and not, rather, a covert continuity of underground, anti-mainstream, anti-industrialized aesthetic practices. What might an \u201cEnglish\u201d avant-garde mean outside its privileged location in high modernism (what might, for instance, a \u201cVictorian avant-garde\u201d come to signify?) and how does this avant-garde disguise its vanguardism in a seemingly conservative system of antiquarian desire (the return to nature, to medievalism, to a handcraft market, to a pre-Raphael state, etc.)? We will also investigate the complicated relationship shared by the seemingly opposed media of the visual arts (painting, photography, interior design), and that of textual production (poetry, prose, novel-writing). What occurs when painters/poets transition from one medium to another: is there an unavoidable slippage, overlap, or contamination of the lexical and graphical systems of composition? How does the Ut pictura poesis tradition keep the need for the \u201cavant-garde\u201d alive in generating alternate markets of practice, consumption, and social change? (B, C, G)

In studying this history, and in replicating and adapting both older and more recent quantitative analyses of literary texts, students chart literature\u2019s engagement with other disciplines and pursue what University of Chicago English professor Edith Rickert described in her 1927 book on quantitative analysis as \u201cnew methods for the study of literature.\u201d (H)

How do such basic features as titles and chapter divisions contribute to novelistic meanings?

V\u000aWhat does it mean to call a work of literature transnational? And more importantly, what does it matter? Despite the recent surge in the term\u2019s stock neither of these questions elicit self-evident answers. Given the general lack of clarity, this course aims to survey the transnational turn in literary studies with an eye to developing students\u2019 abilities to speak and write cogently about the global dimensions of a literary text. We will take up a particularly rich sub-discipline within transnational studies: the study of American literature in an expanded cultural and historical field. We will read a variety of canonical texts written over the past century or so, treating them as archives of ideas and processes that originate and circulate outside of the nation. Primary readings will include novels that address the African diaspora and Black Atlantic (Morrison, Larsen), the hemispheric Americas (Diaz, Didion), interwar modernism (Faulkner), and postwar cosmopolitanism (Bellow, Bowles). Critical readings will orient and introduce us to key debates within the field, including questions of empire, war, diaspora, political economy, and decolonization. Through close formal analysis we will test the capacities of fiction to convert these global developments into rich aesthetic narratives that help us remap America\u2019s place in the world. (B)

We will continue with fictional and non-fictional narrative responses to apartheid and decolonization in film and in print, and examine the power and the limits of what critic Louise Bethlehem has called the \u201crhetoric of urgency\u201d on local and international audiences. We will conclude with writing and film that grapples with the complexities of the post-apartheid world, whose challenges, from crime and corruption to AIDS and the particular problems faced by women and gender minorities, elude the heroic formulas of the anti-apartheid struggle era.

V\u000aDuring the 19th and 20th centuries, the American West became both owned by and part of the United States. This was a dual conquest: a violent wresting of land from both nature and indigenous cultures as well as a voracious assimilation of knowledge about a place. Beginning in Gold Rush California around 1849 and ending with contemporary culture\u2019s obsession with Western images and themes, this course asks students to apply historical and literary critical methods to literary genres of conquest and of regionalism. We will ask such questions as: What is the relationship between knowing and owning? What links a literature to a geographic space? How does a legacy of conquest mark both a regional and national literature? Readings will include texts by John Rollin Ridge, Mark Twain, Helen Hunt Jackson, Frederick Jackson Turner, Frank Norris, Willa Cather, John Steinbeck, and Cormac McCarthy. (B, G)

V\u000aDespite being the United States\u2019 second-biggest city, the literary and cultural history of Los Angeles remains minor in comparison to analyses of New York and Chicago. LA and its fantasy zone, Hollywood, are spaces that provide mechanisms for reconsidering how contemporary urban development is fundamentally affected by social movements, cultural artifacts, and the changing dynamics of capitalism in the 20th century. This class pulls together a range of literary, filmic, and theoretical texts in the interest of opening our understanding of how LA might be considered a major contributor to contemporary literary and film culture. We will read short fiction, novels, and one play and see six films.

V\u000aIn the nineteenth century, gothic fiction in English is an Anglo-American phenomenon. America\u2019s first internationally recognized literary masterpiece, Rip Van Winkle, is written in England and appears the same year as Frankenstein. Our course will study the transatlantic aspect of the gothic tradition, while we also give full attention to the particular qualities of individual texts. Close reading will be central to our project.  Attention to textual intricacies will lead to questions about gender and psychology, as well as culture. Our authors will include Washington Irving, Mary Shelley, James Hogg, Poe, Hawthorne, Emily Bronte, Harriet Prescott Spofford, Joseph Sheridan LeFanu, Henry James, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, and Thomas Hardy.

V\u000aIt is frequently said that poetry cannot be translated, or can only be translated with significant loss. Yet translations of poetry continue to appear, and the work of some poets even seems to thrive in translation. Can translation theory help us to account for this apparent paradox? This course will introduce students to classic and contemporary texts of translation theory in the West, with an eye to the relevance of these theories for the difficulties and promises of translating poetry. We will read theoretical texts by Jerome, Dryden, Herder, Schleiermacher, Nietzsche, Benjamin, Pound and others, and will test these theories against one another and against various English translations of excerpts taken from Dante's Inferno, as well as translations of individual poems from Charles Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du Mal and Petits Poèmes en prose. Students will have the opportunity to produce their own translations as part of their required work for the course.

V\u000aGertrude Stein famously stated, \u201cAmerica is my country, and Paris is my home town.\u201d A significant number of major literary modernists writing in English might have agreed with her. Indeed, French history and culture as a whole was variously reflected upon, responded to, torn apart, and reverenced in the writings of modernists like T.S. Eliot, James Joyce, Hope Mirrlees, Djuna Barnes, Ernest Hemingway, F. S. Fitzgerald, Samuel Beckett, Henry James, Virginia Woolf, and many others. This course situates the work of important modernist figures of British and American literature alongside the critical and cultural French contexts in which it emerged. From poet Charles Baudelaire, considered by many scholars to be the progenitor of 20th century modernism, to the concrete poetry of Guillaume Apollinaire and the Surrealist experiments of Andre Breton, the iconoclasm and formal innovations of French writers from the mid-19th century onward had a definitive impact on Anglo-American modernism and the stylistic and thematic engagements of its practitioners. In this course, we will read key texts of literary and artistic movements like Cubism, Imagism, and Surrealism with specific attention to their local conditions of composition and distribution and a focus on the artistic coteries that welcomed them. At the same time, we will consider modernism\u2019s international aspirations and the wider milieu of national or international audiences to whom this work was addressed. Students who read French are welcome to read French texts in the original, but class discussion and all readings will be provided in English. (C, G)

V\u000aPhilosophers and literary critics of various stripes have been attracted to the detective story, often taking its intrepid protagonist as a figure for the reader and the genre itself as an exploration into practices of reading and interpretation. This course will examine the form and context of the detective story and some of the key critical and theoretical work the genre has inspired. We will read examples of British and American detective fiction, asking: What is the nature of the pleasure the detective story delivers? How\u2014and why\u2014has this genre become a favorite object of study for some of the most influential theorists of the twentieth century? How does detective fiction, a formula which allows for seemingly endless variety, evoke the ongoing and open-ended dynamic between modern rationality and something like \u201cnatural\u201d intuition? We\u2019ll consider the answers to these questions proposed by selected theorists of the genre, as well as the critical and self-reflective writings of the detective-story writers themselves.

V\u000aThis course looks at the culture, technology, politics and ecology of industrial agriculture through the lens of the animal-based "factory" farm. Over the quarter we will trace key steps along the process of manufacturing industrialized animals from life to death in order to think about the factory farm's logic, value, and consequences for rural environments (primarily) within the United States. By emphasizing the historical and cultural conditions of possibility that enable the modern-day factory farm, this course illustrates how mass-producing life forms is more than just a matter of technology, profit-making, or necessity. Instead, we will see how legal definitions of the \u201cfarm\u201d versus the \u201cfactory\u201d, ideological notions of animal (and human) \u201cnature\u201d, labor law, animal confinement, and the corporate ownership of genetic breeds contribute to its growing ascendancy as a global norm of animal production. But the factory farm has also led to new ideals for rural life that go far beyond classic forms of American agrarianism. As such, we will look to a series of case studies that take up the ecological politics of heritage-breed animals, raw milk production, and recent (Europe-based) projects that try to redeem certain elements of industrial agriculture. Along the way, students will receive an introduction to the analysis of food chains, applied ethology, animal studies, agrarian studies, and rural environmental politics.

V\u000aThe United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction defines disaster in three crucial terms: hazards, vulnerability, and capacity. While only the first of these can be "natural\u2019"in the way that that term is commonly understood, catastrophic events and processes are frequently represented as exogenous, autonomous, and unpredictable elements of a bio-physical world. Beginning from the theorization of disaster as a property of nature, this seminar examines the political ecology of drought, flood, earthquake, and famine in their historical, economic, and cultural contexts, focusing on community vulnerability and capacity as outcomes of socio-natural histories and relations. Drawing on historical and contemporary case studies, we will consider a number of dimensions of the dynamic between nature, dislocation, and communities in an increasingly vulnerable world.

We will examine case studies that are representative of various social contexts (e.g., indigenous, national), geographical scales (e.g., local, transnational), and ecological settings (e.g., seas, forests) to examine the ways people understand and relate to different environments in Southeast Asia.  To understand the complex political, economic, and cultural factors that shape human-environment interactions in this dynamic region, the class will draw from a set of texts and analytical perspectives that crosses disciplines. Readings will include literary, historical, and theoretical texts by both Southeast Asian and Western writers to consider the various ways nonhuman nature is understood and engaged with across temporal and cultural settings. We will utilize an interdisciplinary set of concepts and analytical tools from the arts, humanities, and environmental sciences to help us think more rigorously and imaginatively about the environment.

In this course, we use the history of non-industrial agriculture to think through some contemporary concerns about environmental change and the sources of our food\u2014including topics such as genetically modified plants, fertilizers, sustainability, and invasive species. Beginning with the origins of agriculture in the early Holocene, we examine several forms of so-called "traditional" agriculture in the tropics and elsewhere, from swidden to intensive cropping. While the course is framed in terms of contemporary concerns, our focus is primarily historical and ethnographic, focusing on the experiences of agriculturalists over the last ten thousand years, including non-industrial farmers today. Students will be expected to produce and present a research paper.

V\u000aThe connections between environment, agriculture, and food are inherent in our social, cultural, and economic networks. Land use, natural resource management, energy balances, and environmental impacts are all important components in the evolution of agricultural systems. Therefore it is important to develop ways in which to understand these connections in order to design effective agricultural programs and policies. This course is designed to provide students with guidance on the models and tools needed to conduct an economic research study on the intersecting topics of environment, agriculture, and food. Students learn how to develop original research ideas using a quantitative and applied economic policy analysis for professional and scholarly audiences. Students collect, synthesize, and analyze data using economic and statistical tools. Students provide outcomes and recommendations based on scholarly, objective, and policy relevant research rather than on advocacy or opinions, and produce a final professional-quality report for a workshop presentation and publication.

V\u000aDo you know where your next meal will come from? Many people around the world, and even close to home, do not. The Food and Agricultural Organization explains that food security exists when all people, at all times, have physical, social, and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life.  Food security is thus a complex issue involving aspects of food production and distribution, poverty, buying power, and social networks, and cultural choice.  In this course we use the Calumet region as a case study to examine some aspects of the food security debate, especially the basic conceptual divide between the framework of food security, as defined by international organizations above, and the more grass-roots notion of food sovereignty.  Though we will aim for an overview of the issues, we focus this quarter more specifically on issues of agriculture and the food system, including urban agriculture, permaculture, and other challenges to the dominant industrial model.  In a region with significant economic distress and area of \u201cfood desert,\u201d the Calumet presents examples of both challenge and response to this critical topic.

V\u000aThis course looks at Wright's work from multiple angles. We examine his architecture, urbanism, and relationship to the built environment, as well as the socio-cultural context of his lifetime and legend. We take advantage of the Robie House on campus and of the rich legacy of Wright's early work in Chicago; we also think about his later Usonian houses for middle-income clients and the urban framework he imagined for his work (Broadacre City), as well as his Wisconsin headquarters (Taliesin), and spectacular works like the Johnson Wax Factory (a field trip, if funds permit), Fallingwater, and the Guggenheim Museum. By examining one architect's work in context, students gain experience analyzing buildings and their siting, and interpreting them in light of their complex ingredients and circumstances. The overall goal is to provide an introduction to thinking about architecture and urbanism.

V\u000aThis course is first of all a close reading of Marsilio Ficino\u2019s seminal book On Love (first Latin edition De amore 1484; Ficino\u2019s own Italian translation 1544). Ficino\u2019s philosophical masterpiece is the foundation of the Renaissance view of love from a Neo-Platonic perspective. It is impossible to overemphasize its influence on European culture. On Love is not just a radically new interpretation of Plato\u2019s Symposium. It is the book through which sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Europe read the love experience. Our course will analyze its multiple classical sources and its spiritual connotations. During our close reading of Ficino\u2019s text, we will show how European writers and philosophers appropriated specific parts of this Renaissance masterpiece. In particular, we will read extensive excerpts from some important love treatises, such as Castiglione\u2019s The Courtier (Il cortigiano), Leone Ebreo\u2019s Dialogues on Love, Tullia d\u2019Aragona\u2019s On the Infinity of Love, but also selections from a variety of European poets, such as Michelangelo\u2019s canzoniere, Maurice Scève\u2019s Délie, and Fray Luis de León\u2019s Poesía.

V\u000aThe central focus of this course will be Michelangelo\u2019s prolific production in sculpture, painting, and architecture while making substantial use of his writings, both poetry and letters, and his extensive extant body of preparatory drawings to help us understand more about his artistic personality, creative processes, theories of art, and his intellectual and spiritual biography, including his changing attitudes towards Neoplatonism, Christianity, and politics. Our structure will be roughly chronological starting with his highly precocious juvenilia of the 1490s in Florence at the court of Lorenzo the Magnificent through his death in Rome in 1564 as an old man who was simultaneously already the deity of art and a lonely, troubled, repentant Christian, producing some of his most moving works in a highly personal style. Beyond close examination of the works themselves, among the themes that will receive considerable attention for the ways they bear upon his art are Michelangelo\u2019s fraught relationship with patrons such as the Medici and a succession of popes; his complex devotion to and rivalry with ancient classical art and his living rivalry with Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Bramante, and others; his changing attitude towards religion, especially his engagement with the Catholic Reform and some of its key personalities such as Vittoria Colonna; his sexuality and how it might bear on the representation of gender in his art and poetry; his \u201cofficial\u201d biographies created by the devotees Giorgio Vasari (1550, 1568) and Ascanio Condivii (1553) during Michelangelo\u2019s lifetime and some of the most influential moments in the artist\u2019s complex, sometimes ambivalent, reception over the centuries; new approaches and ideas about Michelangelo that have emerged in recent decades from the unabated torrent of scholarship and, especially, the restoration and scientific imaging of many of his works. Through the concentrated art-historical material studied, the course will take seriously the attempt to introduce students with little or no background in art or art history to some of the major avenues for interpretation in this field, including formal, stylistic, iconographical, psychological, social, feminist, theoretical, and reception. Readings are chosen with this diversity of approach in mind.

V\u000aWritten in the midst of the social disruption caused by the Black Death (1348), the Decameron may have held readers attention for centuries because of its bawdiness, but it is also a profound exploration into the basis of faith and the meaning of death, the status of language, the construction of social hierarchy and social order, and the nature of crisis and historical change. Framed by a storytelling contest between seven young ladies and three young men who have left the city to avoid the plague, the one hundred stories of Boccaccio\u2019s Decameron form a structural masterpiece that anticipates the Renaissance epics, Chaucer\u2019s Canterbury Tales, and the modern short story.

V\u000aThe aim of this course is to introduce one of the most important and discussed works pertaining to the continental field of philosophy of the 20th century: Heidegger's Being and Time. The course is structured by two main movements. On the one hand we introduce the main and fundamental concepts developed by Heidegger in his work through analytic sessions devoted to the most important sections of Sein und Zeit. On the other hand, we follow the way Sein und Zeit was received and discussed in the field of French contemporary continental philosophy, especially through Derrida's and Levinas's interpretations and discussions of Sein und Zeit. The double structure of our itinerary obeys a philosophical necessity which takes the form of a leading question: Is it possible to think beyond the primacy of the horizon of Being\u2014drawn by Heidegger in Sein und Zeit\u2014anything like an "Otherwise than Being"? And if so, we will have to elucidate why and in what sense such an alternative horizon of sense does not entail the abandonment of the Heideggerian Question of Being, but leads, on the contrary, to the full explanation of the background without which the Question of Being raised by Sein und Zeit becomes unintelligible.

V\u000aThroughout the Middle Ages, formal education began with the study of language: grammar, including the study of literature as well as the practical mastery of the mechanics of language (here, Latin); logic or dialectic, whether narrowly defined as the art of constructing arguments or, more generally, as metaphysics, including the philosophy of mind; and rhetoric, or the art of speaking well, whether to praise or to persuade. In this course, we will be following this medieval curriculum insofar as we are able through some of its primary texts, many only recently translated, so as to come to a better appreciation of the way in which the study of these arts affected the development of medieval European intellectual and artistic culture.

V\u000aThe main focus of this course will be a careful reading of Cao Xueqin\u2019s eighteenth-century masterpiece Dream of the Red Chamber (Honglou meng). In the process, we will examine some of the range of texts, images, and issues across various literary and cultural genres in late-imperial China that this immensely complex novel draws on. The hope is that in doing so we will gain a deeper appreciation both of the novel itself and of the culture of late-imperial China. We will read about and discuss such topics as gender, erotic desire, relations between text and commentary, and the world of theater and performance, as well as dimensions of material culture and theories of medicine and illness. Adaptions of the novel into various media\u2014opera, film, and TV\u2014may also be incorporated into class discussions or occasionally screened outside class. All readings are in English, using the Penguin translation entitled The Story of the Stone.

V\u000aRédigé en 1580 et 1581, le journal de voyage en Allemagne, en Suisse et en Italie de Montaigne constitue un riche commentaire sur les pratiques politiques, religieuses et culturelles de l'Europe à la fin de la Renaissance. Ainsi, la première partie du journal de voyage met en évidence cette préoccupation politique. On a souligné que les étapes en Alsace, en Allemagne du Sud, en Suisse alémanique et en Autriche se présentaient comme une série d\u2019« impressions de voyage en Eucharistie  ». Sans aller jusqu\u2019à comparer ce voyage avec une excursion en terre cannibale ou dans le Nouveau Monde, il est pourtant vrai que Montaigne découvrit des modèles politiques fondamentalement dissemblables de ceux que la Réforme lui avait fait connaître en France. Le grand apport de ce voyage en Allemagne, Autriche et Suisse fut sans nul doute une perception de la religion plus anthropologique et politique que théologique; elle favorisa le développement d\u2019une expérience de terrain avant de rejoindre Rome. Nous verrons comment le Journal de voyage de Montaigne constitue un document politique et culturel pour Montaigne.

V\u000aThe course will provide a close reading of Cervantes' Don Quixote and discuss its links with Renaissance art and Early Modern narrative genres. On the one hand, Don Quixote can be viewed in terms of prose fiction, from the ancient Greek romances to the medieval books of knights errant and the Renaissance pastoral novels. On the other hand, Don Quixote exhibits a desire for Italy through the utilization of Renaissance art. Beneath the dusty roads of La Mancha and within Don Quixote\u2019s chivalric fantasies, the careful reader will come to appreciate glimpses of images with Italian designs. Taught in English. Spanish majors will read the text in the original and use Spanish for the course assignments. The course format would be alternating lectures by the two faculty members on Mondays and Wednesdays.

V\u000aThis class is an inquiry into the medieval romance genre through the close and comparative reading of one of its oldest extant representatives, Gorgâni\u2019s Vis & Râmin (c. 1050). With roots that go back to Late Antiquity, this romance is a valuable interlocutor between the Greek novel and the Ovidian erotic tradition, Arabic love theory and poetics, and well-known European romances like Tristan, Lancelot, and Cligès: a sustained exploration of psychological turmoil and moral indecision, and a vivid dramatization of the many contradictions inherent in erotic theory, most starkly by the lovers' faithful adultery. By reading Vis & Râmin alongside some of its generic neighbors (Kallirrhoe, Leukippe, Tristan, Cligès), as well as the love-theories of writers like Plato, Ovid, Avicenna, Jâhiz, Ibn Hazm, and Andreas Cappellanus, we will map out the various kinds of literary work the romance is called upon to do, and investigate the myriad and shifting conceptions of romantic love as performance, subjectivity, and moral practice. An optional section introducing selections from the original text in Persian will be available if there is sufficient student interest.

V\u000aIn this course, we dwell on Witold Gombrowicz the philosopher, exploring the components of his authorial style and concepts that substantiate his claim to both the literary and the philosophical spheres. Entangled in an ongoing battle with basic philosophical tenets and, indeed, with existence itself, this erudite Polish author is a prime example of a 20th century modernist whose philosophical novels explode with uncanny laughter. In contrast to many of his contemporaries, who established their reputations as writers/philosophers, Gombrowicz applied distinctly literary models to the same questions that they explored. We investigate these models in depth, as we focus on Gombrowicz\u2019s novels, philosophical lectures, and some of his autobiographical writings. With an insight from recent criticism of these primary texts, we seek answers to the more general question: What makes this author a philosopher?

V\u000aFocusing on the pre-modern city primarily in Italy, this seminar seeks to introduce upper level undergraduate and graduate students in the humanities to the way in which art and architecture were elements within a comprehensive urban system that included civic, religious, and daily rituals, both modest and spectacular. The pre-modern city was the site of a whole range of practices in which art played an important but integrated role. The assumption of such a course is that the paintings, sculptures, and artifacts that remain in museums and collections today are only a part of what was once a whole set of social relations between the individual and the collective, between the sacred and the profane. Consequently, through a series of readings that will focus on experience rather than aesthetic production, students will be encouraged to develop research projects that go beyond the frame of the work of art in order to see how it was intimately connected to the structure of urban life and how it profoundly affected the lives of its audience.

This experimental period generated theoretical writing that continues to matter to architects today; we will study it in terms of its initial contexts and application. Major themes are: (1) the relationship of a building\u2019s structure to its decoration (or body to clothing, as it was sometimes put); (2) the rise of historical interest in older buildings from divergent stylistic traditions (e.g., classical and Gothic) and its impact on new design; (3) the development of aesthetic theory suited to mass as well as elite audiences (e.g., the sublime and the picturesque); and (4) the idea that architect and building could and should be ethical or socially reformative.

V\u000aThis course explores an intensely productive, stormy, even delirious period in Italian film culture between 1960 and 1975. In that era the material and social transformations effected by the economic boom, the marketing of Italy\u2019s luxury image, the student movements, and the rise of left and right wing terrorism provoked some of the richest, most innovative work by such filmmakers as Antonioni, Pasolini, Bellocchio, Leone, among others. This Italian "New Wave," distinct from its French counterpart, responded to a host of political and cultural imperatives through new visions of urban space, of social and sexual mores, the relation of "high" and "low," and revisitations of the past both near and distant. These and related questions bound up with film culture and aesthetics we shall discuss in light of both monumental and lesser-known works. All readings in English.

La tradition et les textes de l\u2019Antiquité ne suffisaient plus pour comprendre l\u2019homme et le monde. Certains virent dans leur époque un renouveau, d\u2019autres un progrès, d\u2019autres encore un déclin, ou, comme Montaigne, un progrès dans le déclin. Bref, la Renaissance s'interroge sur sa propre histoire et offre une multitude de modèles théoriques pour sa compréhension et son écriture. A partir des textes de Machiavel, Jean Bodin, La Pope linière, Loys Le Roy, Montaigne et d\u2019autres auteurs, nous verrons comment s\u2019écrit l\u2019histoire aux débuts de la modernité.

Beginning with the crisis of naturalism in the late nineteenth century, we will consider the inflections given to literary representation by historical cataclysm, the avant-garde critique of the novel, and the postwar "age of suspicion." We will investigate the reformulations of literature's relationship to reality offered by theories of literary commitment and by the experiments of the Nouveau Roman. Finally, we will evaluate the phenomenon of the "return to the real" in contemporary French literature. Readings will include works by Aragon, Céline, Sartre, Robbe-Grillet, Sarraute, Perec, and Pierre Michon.

We will focus primarily on two clusters of problems. First, we will examine what Alexander\u2019s career can tell us about the dynamics of ancient empires. Second, we will grapple with the interpretative challenges generated by our evidence, which consists largely of literary accounts produced by authors who wrote long after Alexander\u2019s own lifetime and who relied on earlier texts that no longer survive. All sources will be read in translation.

Its method consists of reading extensively in the historiography and reflecting intensively on the issues raised by that reading. So as to maintain a well-defined focus the course is limited largely to the Reformation in Germany. So as to develop a broad perspective the course is not limited to the most recent literature. We will begin with some of the most famous older interpretations (Hegel, Ranke, Engels, Troeltsch, Weber, Febvre). We will then go on to consider the redefinition of the historical agenda since the 1960s and the current state of our knowledge by reading the work of leading contemporary historians of the Reformation (e.g., Bernd Moeller, Thomas Brady, Heiko Oberman, Jean Delumeau, Peter Blickle, Heinz Schilling).

V\u000aOne can distinguish four ways in which science and aesthetics are related during the last three centuries. First, science has been the subject of artistic effort in painting and photography and in poetry and novels (e.g., in Goethe\u2019s poetry or in H. G. Wells\u2019s Island of Doctor Moreau). Second, science has been used to explain aesthetic effects (e.g., Helmholtz\u2019s work on the way painters achieve visual effects or musicians achieve tonal effects). Third, aesthetic means have been used to convey scientific conceptions (e.g., through illustrations in scientific volumes or through aesthetically affective and effective writing). Finally philosophers have stepped back to consider the relationship between scientific knowing and aesthetic comprehension (e.g., Kant and Bas van Fraassen). In this course, we will consider these four modes of relationship. The first part of the quarter will be devoted to Kant, reading carefully his third critique; then we will turn to Goethe and Helmholtz, both feeling the impact of Kant, and to Wells, a student of T. H. Huxley. We then consider more contemporary modes expressive of the relationship, especially the role of illustrations in science and the work of contemporary philosophers like Fraassen.

Beginning with the scientific racism that dominated the late-nineteenth century, we will examine the claims and methods of diverse "scientific" interventions over the first half of the twentieth century that both challenged and confirmed racist thinking, including intelligence testing and blood work during World War I, the work of Franz Boas and his students, the Chicago school of sociology, and state policies addressing the race question in the post\u2013WWII era (including the United Nations' UNESCO reports). Our emphasis throughout will be on how social historical and political forces shaped and were shaped in turn by twentieth-century science.

Through this debate, which has been sometimes explicit and at other times sub-rosa, we will probe the meanings and significance attributed to race, culture, and their interrelationship. Among the topics to be addressed in lectures and discussions are the debates on the relation between slave culture and resistance, the contrasting ways black and white performers have engaged the minstrel tradition, the social interpretations of black musical expression, the role to the state in promoting black cultural expression, and culture as a site of resistance.  Each topic will be addressed through lectures and class discussions.

V\u000aThis course looks at the reception of Giambattista Vico (1668\u20131744), whose philosophy, largely neglected at first, eventually came to enjoy far-reaching influence as European thinkers set out on repeated quests for the source of a different \u201cmodernity\u201d or \u201cCounter-Enlightenment\u201d in fields as varied as political theory (Romagnosi, Cattaneo, Ferrari), the historical and modernist novel (Cuoco, Manzoni, Joyce), Romantic historiography (Michelet, Gioberti), literary criticism (Auerbach), and intellectual history (Berlin). What is the secret behind the enduring appeal of Vico\u2019s anti-rationalist stance? This seminar, going further than dedicating itself to the legacy of a single thinker, wishes to investigate the \u201clogic\u201d (or lack thereof) that attends posthumous acclaim, eponymity, and etiological myths, and to provide guidelines for a disciplined approach to the history, practice, and theory of reception.

We will look at the various ways in which contemporary philosophers of Judaism have dealt with suffering, evil and God, especially after the experience of the Shoah. We will examine the often repeated claim that Judaism has approached the philosophical and religious challenges of suffering more through an ethics of suffering than on the basis of a metaphysics of suffering. After an introductory discussion of Maimonides on the Book of Job, readings for the course may come from authors such as E. Lévinas, J.B. Soloveitchik, Y. Leibowitz, H. Jonas, A. Lichtenstein, D.W. Halivni, D. Shatz, and E. Berkovits. The course will culminate in a philosophical analysis of some of the most important writings of Primo Levi.

V\u000aWhat is enlightenment? How does one become enlightened, and who is enlightened? In Euro-American civilization, the eighteenth-century Age of Enlightenment championed the powers of human reason against religion and superstition to achieve scientific progress. Buddhism in the nineteenth century was represented by the heirs of Enlightenment as a religion for the Enlightenment to the point of not being a religion at all. Both traditions offer pathways to freedom (or liberation?) that draw on our rational capabilities, and both sponsor the production of knowledge that re-visions our place in the world. But they seem to be opposed: how could reason reject \u201creligious\u201d beliefs but also take part in \u201creligious\u201d traditions that aim to bring certain kinds of persons into being? We compare the mental models, discourses, methods of analysis, world-images, and practices of these traditions of enlightenment to assess the kinds of disciplines that their theoreticians and practitioners acquire and use.

V\u000aScience and religion are two ways, among many others, that people can seek to know about reality: how do we construct ordered pictures of the whole\u2014cosmos or civilization\u2014and how do we relate to them in terms of action? How do we know what we do not know, and what does that kind of \u201cknowledge\u201d mean for the orientation and direction of human existence? How would cultural biases be affected by knowing that there are others \u201cout there\u201d in the universe, should we discover them? From various perspectives, this course addresses these questions of the origins, structures, and ends of reality as we look for ourselves\u2014seek understanding of the human condition\u2014in the cosmos but also in complex religious and cultural traditions. Whereas in our popular culture, science is often identified with the realm of knowledge and religion is simply \u201cbelief\u201d or \u201cpractice,\u201d the course also seeks to trace the rational limits of science and the rational force of religion with respect to the ethical problem of the right and good conduct of human life.

V\u000aFrom the 1830s to the 1890s, most Russian prose writers and playwrights were either engaged in the European-wide cultural movement known as "realistic school" which set for itself the task of engaging with social processes from the standpoint of political ideologies. The ultimate goal of this course is to distill more precise meanings of "realism," "critical realism,"and "naturalism" in nineteenth-century Russian through analysis of works by Gogol, Turgenev, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Aleksandr Ostrovsky, Goncharov, Saltykov-Shchedrin, and Kuprin.

The change of political regimes has only been outpaced by the change of aesthetic regimes, from realism to symbolism, and then from socialist realism to post-modernism. We sample the major writers, texts, and literary doctrines, paying close attention to the way they responded and contributed to historical events. This course counts as the third part of the survey of Russian literature. Texts in English.

V\u000aIn this course we will study some of the main intellectual currents in the Spanish-speaking Caribbean during the nineteenth century and their relationships to the literary production of the period. In particular, we will address the reformulation of ideas of the Enlightenment, liberalism, and philosophical Positivism, both for political reflections upon slavery, colonialism, and projects of national independence and social reform as well as for literary aesthetics. How did predicaments of the Enlightenment come to structure pro-slavery thought? What was the relationship between liberalism and abolitionism? How did philosophical principles related to the development of the natural sciences support or undermine projects of national independence and/or of social emancipation (such as women's and labor rights)? And what did literature have to do with these issues? Among the authors we may study are Francisco de Arango y Parreño, Félix Varela, José Antonio Saco, Gertrudis Gómez de Avellaneda, Condesa de Merlín, Eugenio María de Hostos, Enrique José Varona, José de Jesús Galván, José Martí, and Luisa Capetillo.

V\u000aIn classical mythology, Astraea, the goddess of justice, chastity, and truth, was the last of the immortals to leave earth with the decline of the ages. Her return was to signal the dawn of a new Golden Age. During the Spanish seventeenth century, her myth was utilized by a number of playwrights, but particularly by Calderón de la Barca to delve into a series of questions. As an astral myth, it allowed poets to delve into astrological matters at a time when this art still enjoyed much popularity. The course will analyze the presence of planets and zodiacal signs, of miraculous stars and horoscopes to discuss the topical uses of astrology and the limits of its orthodoxy. While Aratus discussed the astronomical implications of the myth in ancient times, Virgil transformed it into an imperial myth, proclaiming that she would return to Rome without the need for ekpyrosis. Thus, Philip IV appropriated the myth in Spain to proclaim the renovation that was to take place during his reign. Playwrights would thus praise Philip through this myth. It also has been argued that Astraea also served to point to the regime\u2019s failures. The course will then study the political implications of the myth. Among the plays by Calderón that will be included are: La gran Cenobia, La vida es sueño, El mayor encanto amor, Los tres mayores prodigios, and El monstruo de los jardines.

The \u2018Middle Sea\u2019 was not only the geographical framework for a large corpus of Iberian narratives, poems, and plays of the early modern period, but also a discursive space where many political, religious, and cultural ideas of the period were staged and disputed. We will read portions of sixteenth-century Spanish translations of the Odyssey and the Aeneid, travel writing such as the Viaje de Turquía, captivity narratives by Miguel de Cervantes and Diego Galán, short stories by María de Zayas and Lope de Vega, and poems by Garcilaso de la Vega, Fernando de Herrera, and morisco authors.

V\u000aHow does transgender change feminism? This course will serve as an introduction to the study of gender, transgender, and trans*feminism, a branch of feminism that forefronts the significance of transgender and gender non-conforming phenomena to feminist projects and ideas and vice versa. Relations between transgender and gender non-conforming individuals and U.S. feminisms have not been easy. This course will begin by exploring some of those contentious encounters in order to address the differing interpretations of gender and social justice at work in each. We will then fan out both backwards and forward in time. We will look at histories of gender non-conforming phenomena in the U.S. that pre-date the coinage of the word transgender, such as those found in George Chauncey\u2019s Gay New York: Gender, Urban Culture, and the Making of the Gay Male World 1890-1940, Esther Newton\u2019s Mother Camp: Female Impersonators in America, and various documentations of both the Stonewall riots and the riot at Compton Cafeteria\u2014histories that bring transgender phenomena in (anachronistic) contact with the many sexual histories of the U.S. We will consider as well key texts in feminist theory worrying the relation between gender and sexuality by such authors as Judith Butler, Audre Lorde, and Monique Wittig. Finally, we will turn to essays, novels, manifestoes, films, and documentaries from the 1990s onwards\u2014by such author-activists as Sharon Bridgforth, Eli Clare, Leslie Feinberg, Vic Muñoz, Vivian Namaste, Sylvia Rivera, Dean Spade, Susan Stryker, and Riki Wilchins\u2014in order to explore how transgender and feminism transform each other.

Its aim is triple: to engage scenes and concepts central to the interdisciplinary study of gender and sexuality; to provide familiarity with key theoretical anchors for that study; and to provide skills for deriving the theoretical bases of any kind of method. Students will produce descriptive, argumentative, and experimental engagements with theory and its scenes as the quarter progresses. Prior course experience in gender/sexuality studies (by way of the Civilization Core or other course work) is strongly advised.

The \u201cCreativity and Cultural Knowledge\u201d cluster addresses the themes of authorship and authority, fighting and constructing the canon, and the debates over the influence of \u201cdifference\u201d on cultural forms.

We analyze the construction of social problems and moral panics (e.g., smoking, "satanic" daycares, obesity) to explore how various moral entrepreneurs shape what some sociologists call a "culture of fear." Additionally, we investigate the impact on individuals of being labeled "deviant" either voluntarily or involuntarily, as a way of illustrating how both social control and social change operate in society.

V\u000aThere is a substantial portion of the psychological nature of human beings that is neither homogeneous nor fixed across time and space. At the heart of the discipline of cultural psychology is the tenet of psychological pluralism, which states that the study of "normal" psychology is the study of multiple psychologies and not just the study of a single or uniform fundamental psychology for all peoples of the world. Research findings in cultural psychology thus raise provocative questions about the integrity and value of alternative forms of subjectivity across cultural groups. In this course we analyze the concept of "culture" and examine ethnic and cross-cultural variations in mental functioning with special attention to the cultural psychology of emotions, self, moral judgment, categorization, and reasoning.

V\u000aFrom Winter 2014 Description: This year the class will focus on affect theory in relation to debates in contemporary queer and feminist theory:  rights, normativity, love/desire, sex, history, biopower, labor, affect.  Aesthetic objects will be brought into contact with theoretical work: we will be thinking about argument and evidence and also about how mediation and exemplarity matter. Students can choose to write a standard essay or can contribute to constructing class anthologies that will contextualize three aesthetic works: such as Frank O\u2019Hara\u2019s \u201cHaving a Coke with You\u201d; Saidiya Hartman\u2019s Find Your Mother; Kim Peirce\u2019s Boys Don\u2019t Cry. Key authors include:  Sara Ahmed, Lee Edelman, Patricia Williams, Jose Muñoz, Judith Butler, Eve Sedgwick, Michael Warner, Mel Chen, Jasbir Puar, Gayatri Gopinath, Leo Bersani, Michael Foucault, Gayatri Spivak, Fred Moten, Jennifer Doyle.

V\u000aThis is a seminar/workshop many of whose participants are faculty from various related disciplines. It admits approximately ten students. Its aim is to study, each year, a topic that arises in both philosophy and the law and to ask how bringing the two fields together may yield mutual illumination. Most sessions are led by visiting speakers, from either outside institutions or our own faculty, who circulate their papers in advance. The session consists of a brief introduction by the speaker, followed by initial questioning by the two faculty coordinators, followed by general discussion, in which students are given priority. Several sessions involve students only, and are led by the instructors. Students write a 20-25 page seminar paper at the end of the year. The course satisfies the Law School Substantial Writing Requirement. There are approximately four meetings in each of the three quarters. Students must therefore enroll for all three quarters.

V\u000aThroughout the cultural history of the West, there seems to be a structural connection between beauty and mourning that reaches from popular fiction to philosophical reflection on the subject: Beauty, it seems, has mourning and pain as its integral part; precisely that which pleases us most moves us to tears\u2014a topical experience that requires no other losses and pains than those induced by beauty itself. What is it that gets mourned in beauty? Is mourning beautiful? Do we mourn the beauty we cannot have? Is beauty something like the mourning of itself? The class analyzes different aspects of the juncture beauty/mourning by drawing on exemplary texts mostly from poetry and philosophy, but also on writing on art, psychoanalysis, and music. (Plato, Ovid, Petrarch, Goethe, Hölderlin, Hegel, Nietzsche, Lorca, Warburg, Freud, Rilke, Brecht, Celan, Plath, etc.)

V\u000aThis lecture course will provide an advanced introduction to European history in the twentieth century. Topics covered will include: (1) the persistence of war from World War I and II to the Cold War, wars of decolonization, and the conflict in former Yugoslavia; (2) the transformations of the relations of state, society, and economy, including the Great Depression and its effects, the rise and fall of the welfare state changes, inflation and monetary crises, as well as the peculiar combination of nationalization and Europeanization; (3) the controversies and confrontations over the remaking of society, including the rearrangement of class and gender relations, the changing place of religious belief, the consequences of postcolonial immigration, and the forging of European-wide consumer identities. The overarching puzzle we face is how we get from an age of empire and a status-driven, but overall pacific, if highly militarized society, at the beginning of the century to the chasm of extreme violence that made Europe between the Urals and the Atlantic into a vast killing field  in mid-century to, at the end of the century, a Europe of interdependent and united, if squabbling nations, that seem to fall apart in discord any minute, but haven\u2019t done so yet; of societies that are at one and the same time remarkably cosmopolitan and haughtily xenophobic; and of economies that have been the more successful the less they have followed a neo-liberal path to economic growth. What do we make of a Europe that has long rolled out of the center of the world and transformed itself into a peaceable kingdom that some compare to a nature park or vast open-air history museum and that for all of that has become rather more attractive than less?

We will: analyze textual and visual strategies for evoking crises; trace how crises reveal the persistence of irrational elements in highly technologized forms of contemporary life; and examine how they determine the way we experience and remember events. Furthermore, we will study the relationship between crises and their various media: poem, play, novel, survival guide, painting, photograph, film, etc. Readings include Walter Benjamin, Paul Celan, Thomas Bernhard, Peter Handke, Alexander Kluge, Kathrin Röggla, Don DeLillo, H.

Exploring philosophies of the comic, as well as filmic and literary material, this seminar seeks to investigate what may be called the serious core of comedy. First, some fundamental theories of comedy, humor, and laughter will be introduced. These range from perspectives of supremacy, relief, shallowness, or negligibility (especially when compared to the tragic), the mechanic, the lowly/corporeal, to theories of incongruity. We will then focus on the critical, transformative, and political potentials of the comic/comedy: ways in which comedy copes with chance and contingencies; with strategies of resistance and inversion in face of disproportionately more powerful opponents; the comic as a mode of inclusion and exclusion; comedy and its relation to freedom and to the sublime; comedy as a means to exceed, undermine, and open up boundaries; the comic as an attempt to get to grips with situations and events we cannot (fully) master. We will also discuss limits and complications of any such critical potential. Readings may include texts by S. Freud, I. Kant, G. W. F. Hegel, F. Th. Vischer, Jean Paul, Søren Kierkegaard, Mikhail Bakhtin, Henri Bergson, Judith Butler, Alenka Zupan\u010di\u010d, and others; films include works by Ernst Lubitsch and Woody Allen.

In addition to these core readings/viewings, we will study the origins of the Faust myth in sixteenth-century Germany and survey its many transformations across art, literature, and music. This course is an excellent introduction to the history of German literature and culture.

V\u000aIn July 2015, the Bavarian State Opera in Munich will present the world premiere of a piece tentatively titled Jephta's Daughter, to be directed by Saar Magal (choreographer and director, Tel Aviv) and conceived by Magal in collaboration with University of Chicago professor David Levin. Magal and Levin will offer a laboratory course in which to prepare the piece. As presently conceived, the piece will combine theater, dance, oratorio, film, contemporary composition, and a variety of contemporary performance idioms to adapt and interrogate the story of Jephta's daughter (in the Book of Judges, from which the story is adapted, she remains nameless). We are hoping to attract students keen to explore a broad cross-section of materials through seminar-style discussion and experimentation on stage. (We will work through biblical criticism, films like Harmony Korine's Spring Breakers (2013) or Ulrich Seidl's Paradise: Love-Faith-Hope, operas like Mozart's Idomeneo, oratorios like Handel's Jephta and Carissimi's Jephta, and a range of critical theory, including Rene Girard's Violence and the Sacred and Derek Hughes's Culture and Sacrifice). Stage work will encompass improvisational, physical, and text-based work. Students with an interest in any of the following are especially welcome: adaptation, theater practice, performance theory, dramaturgy, design, and/or editing.

This course provides a background to understand contemporary problems in a historical context. This includes a close examination and discussion of representative ancient sources, as well as readings in modern scholarship to help us think of interpretative frameworks and questions.

We likewise explore the ways in which archeologists, historians, novelists, and artists emphasized the connectivity between past and present, and the channels through which their new ideas were transmitted. The class thus highlights phenomena like nationalism, reform, and literary and print capitalism (in both Hebrew and Arabic) as experienced in the Middle East.

Yet science continues to pose questions that are challenging and, in some instances, troubling. How will our technologies affect the environment? Should we prevent the cloning of humans? Can we devise a politically acceptable framework for the patenting of life? Such questions make it vitally important that we try to understand what science is and how it works, even if we never enter labs. This course uses evidence from controversies (e.g., Human Genome Project, International Space Station) to throw light on the enterprise of science itself.

Through this debate, which has been sometimes explicit and at other times sub-rosa, we will probe the meanings and significance attributed to race, culture, and their interrelationship. Among the topics to be addressed in lectures and discussions are the debates on the relation between slave culture and resistance, the contrasting ways black and white performers have engaged the minstrel tradition, the social interpretations of black musical expression, the role to the state in promoting black cultural expression, and culture as a site of resistance.  Each topic will be addressed through lectures and class discussions.

Second, we will grapple with the interpretative challenges generated by our evidence, which consists largely of literary accounts produced by authors who wrote long after Alexander\u2019s own lifetime and who relied on earlier texts that no longer survive.

V\u000aThe course will offer a historical and critical perspective on 150 years of archaeology in Israel/Palestine, beginning with the first scientific endeavors of the 19th century and covering British Mandate and pre-state Jewish scholarship, as well as developments in the archaeology of Israel since 1948. I will devote particular attention to the mutual construction of archaeological interpretation and Israeli identity and to the contested role of archaeology in the public sphere both within Israeli society and in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The course will conclude with a discussion of the plausibility and possible content of an indigenous post-conflict archaeology in Israel and Palestine, based on 21st century paradigm shifts in archaeological discourse and field work.

V\u000aThe class will discuss the connections between Israeli history and Jewish history. We will explore the history of the state since its establishment, its intellectual elites, their cultural production, as well as the protests, demonstrations, and sit-ins organized by Israeli Jews in Israel during the years 1948-2012. The class will reflect on tensions between Israelis of different origins, Mizrahi, Ashkenazi and Ethiopian communities in particular, and will discuss whether the arrival of various communities of Jews to Israel signified a liberating exodus from an oppressive  exile; we will therefore consider different periodizations of Israeli history in which the moment of arrival to Israel of various migrants/\u2019olim (like Holocaust survivors, Mizrahi Jews, and others) marked the beginning of a difficult journey, aimed at achieving social mobility and citizenship rights in the Jewish state. We will also look at conflicts based on religion, especially the encounters between Haredi, national-religious and secular Jews in Israel. Finally, we will explore Israel\u2019s relations with its Palestinian citizens and the Palestinian subjects in the occupied West Bank. The class will consider instances of politicized violence in Israel, and reflect on the ways in which their analysis could inform our thinking about social identities, nationalism, and religiosity. We will try to read against, and beyond, national Zionist narratives; unpack many national silences regarding the social and economic tensions embodied in these events, and study their implications with respect to visions of pluralism, binationalism, integration, and nationalism in Israel.

V\u000aThis course will consider the changing function of the notion of the messiah as it developed and changed in the modern era.  It takes as its concrete starting point the Sabbatian Heresy of the 17th century and concludes with Derrida\u2019s philosophical development of the concept of the messianic. The course\u2019s aim is to use messianism as a focal point around which to consider the dynamic relationship between philosophy and Jewish civilization. It will examine the changing representations of the the Messiah within the history of Jewish civilization. Concurrently it will consider the after-effect of these representations on discourses of modernity and vice-versa, illustrating both how Enlightenment conceptions of progress helped to create the notion of \u201cmessianism\u201d understood as an abstract idea, and how the modern/post-modern philosophical conception of the \u201cmessianic\u201d as a force that interrupts time is dependent upon historical studies of the messianic dimension of traditional Judaism.

V\u000aDuring the first seven centuries of its existence, the Holy Roman Empire emerged as one of the most politically and culturally heterogeneous states in all of Europe. A vast expanse of central Europe that is today divided among more than a dozen different nations was ruled, at least in theory, by the emperors during the central and late Middle Ages. The purpose of this course is to trace some of the major developments in imperial history between 800 (Charlemagne\u2019s coronation as emperor) and the early sixteenth century. Topics will include the changing nature of imperial authority from the Carolingians to the Habsburgs, the Church\u2019s and the nobility\u2019s establishment of quasi-independent lordships inside imperial territory, papal-imperial relations, and the eastward expansion of the empire.

V\u000aThis course is designed to clarify and test the assumptions underlying the present state of knowledge about the Protestant Reformation. Its method consists of reading extensively in the historiography and reflecting intensively on the issues raised by that reading. So as to maintain a well-defined focus the course is limited largely to the Reformation in Germany. So as to develop a broad perspective the course is not limited to the most recent literature. We will begin with some of the most famous older interpretations (Hegel, Ranke, Engels, Troeltsch, Weber, Febvre). We will then go on to consider the redefinition of the historical agenda since the 1960s and the current state of our knowledge by reading the work of leading contemporary historians of the Reformation (e.g., Bernd Moeller, Thomas Brady, Heiko Oberman, Jean Delumeau, Peter Blickle, Heinz Schilling). I will focus on explaining the readings, but I will also leave room for questions and discussion.

V\u000aThis lecture course will provide an advanced introduction to European history in the twentieth century. Topics covered will include: (1) the persistence of war from World War I and II to the Cold War, wars of decolonization, and the conflict in former Yugoslavia; (2) the transformations of the relations of state, society, and economy, including the Great Depression and its effects, the rise and fall of the welfare state changes, inflation and monetary crises, as well as the peculiar combination of nationalization and Europeanization; (3) the controversies and confrontations over the remaking of society, including the rearrangement of class and gender relations, the changing place of religious belief, the consequences of postcolonial immigration, and the forging of European-wide consumer identities. The overarching puzzle we face is how we get from an age of empire and a status-driven, but overall pacific, if highly militarized society, at the beginning of the century to the chasm of extreme violence that made Europe between the Urals and the Atlantic into a vast killing field  in mid-century to, at the end of the century, a Europe of interdependent and united, if squabbling nations, that seem to fall apart in discord any minute, but haven\u2019t done so yet; of societies that are at one and the same time remarkably cosmopolitan and haughtily xenophobic; and of economies that have been the more successful the less they have followed a neo-liberal path to economic growth. What do we make of a Europe that has long rolled out of the center of the world and transformed itself into a peaceable kingdom that some compare to a nature park or vast open-air history museum and that for all of that has become rather more attractive than less?

This course considers the many ways in which medieval Europeans used and thought about animals: from the horses, hawks, and hounds of the hunt to the sheep, cows, chickens, and pigs of the home, as well as the lambs, doves, and lions of Holy Scripture, the talking foxes and cats of the beast fable, and the unicorns and dragons of saints\u2019 lives, beastiaries, and travelers\u2019 tales. Topics and questions to be addressed include the economic and social importance of animals, the symbolism of animals, animals in law, science, philosophy, and art, and whether animals were believed to have feelings and/or souls.

In this course, we will be following this medieval curriculum insofar as we are able through some of its primary texts, many only recently translated, so as to come to a better appreciation of the way in which the study of these arts affected the development of medieval European intellectual and artistic culture.

The course examines the emergence of the central power that unified feudal domains and explores processes of social, cultural, and political changes that transformed Japan into a "realm under Heaven." Some scholars consider early modern Japan as the source of an indigenous birth of capitalism, industrialism, and also of Japan\u2019s current economic vitality, while others see a bleak age of feudal oppression and isolation.

What were the similarities and differences in their attempts to modernize China\u2019s economy and transform its social structures? How did they extend their power into villages, factories, and families? How did they mobilize and organize the population? We will look at GMD social policies and industrialization strategies before moving on to CCP political campaigns in the 1950s and 1960s. We will also ask how far Maoist policies after 1958 represented a break with the top-down developmentalism that characterized earlier CCP and GMD approaches.

V\u000aThe history of Maoist China is usually told as a sequence of political campaigns: land and marriage reform, nationalization of industry, anti-rightist campaign, Great Leap Forward, Cultural Revolution, etc. Yet for the majority of the Chinese population, socialism was as much about material changes as about politics: about the two-story brick houses, electric lights, and telephones (loushang louxia, diandeng dianhua) that the revolution had promised; about new work regimes and new consumption patterns\u2014or, to the contrary, about the absence of such change. If we want to understand what socialism meant for different groups of people, we have to look at the "new objects" of  socialist modernity, at changes in dress codes and apartment layouts, at electrification and city planning. We have to analyze workplaces and labor processes in order to understand how socialism changed the way people worked. We also have to look at the rationing of consumer goods and its effects on people's daily lives. The course has a strong comparative dimension: We will look at the literature on socialism in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, to see how Chinese socialism differed from its cousins. Another aim is methodological. How can we understand the lives of people who wrote little and were rarely written about? To what extent can we read people's life experiences out of material objects?

Individual objects will be examined, not only for religious, aesthetic, cultural, and historical issues, but also for what they tell us of the collections and of museum and collections studies in general. The course is also timed to coincide with the reinstallation of the museum's Chinese galleries.

It focuses on the lives of \u201cordinary people,\u201d especially in the countryside, where over 80 percent of China\u2019s population lived until roughly 1980, and over 40 percent still live today. Topics include family organization, relations between the generations, and gender roles; property rights, class relations, and their implications for economic activity; the nature of village communities and their relationship to political/legal authority; migration, frontier settlement, and changes in ethnic and national identity; twentieth-century urbanization, consumerism, and changing notions of the individual; and collective protest, violence, and revolution. A secondary theme is more theoretical: what is it possible to know about the lives of people who left few records of their own, and how do we evaluate what are often, inevitably, thinly documented claims? The class format will include a lot of lecture, but mixed with both in-class and online discussion. No background knowledge is required.

V\u000aOne can distinguish four ways in which science and aesthetics are related during the last three centuries. First, science has been the subject of artistic effort in painting and photography and in poetry and novels (e.g., in Goethe\u2019s poetry or in H. G. Wells\u2019s Island of Doctor Moreau). Second, science has been used to explain aesthetic effects (e.g., Helmholtz\u2019s work on the way painters achieve visual effects or musicians achieve tonal effects). Third, aesthetic means have been used to convey scientific conceptions (e.g., through illustrations in scientific volumes or through aesthetically affective and effective writing). Finally philosophers have stepped back to consider the relationship between scientific knowing and aesthetic comprehension (e.g., Kant and Bas van Fraassen). In this course, we will consider these four modes of relationship. The first part of the quarter will be devoted to Kant, reading carefully his third critique; then we will turn to Goethe and Helmholtz, both feeling the impact of Kant, and to Wells, a student of T. H. Huxley. We then consider more contemporary modes expressive of the relationship, especially the role of illustrations in science and the work of contemporary philosophers like Fraassen.

This course aims to examine both this circumstance and its social memory: how and why contemporary narratives have dealt with this historical issue, usually portrayed as a mirror or a precedent for present day situations in which different religious and cultural communities share the same political and social arena. The course is conceived as a dialogue between the past and the present, between the evidence from remote times and the conflicting perceptions, interpretations, and misconceptions that are built upon this evidence. In so doing, the objective is to address a number of pressing questions regarding the uses and abuses of history, its role as forger of identities, communities, or values, and, more particularly, the difficult relations of contemporary Spain with its own past.

Formally these films share certain commonalities with Latin American, Eastern European cinemas and even the various European new waves. Is it possible however to read a radical politics and ethics into films and filmmakers who did not self-consciously describe themselves as such? To what extent does political cinema and extra-cinematic discussions of such films compromise questions of formalism? This course will analyze these and related issues by looking closely at Indian cinema from 1947 to 1977. We will be watching and discussing both \u201cpopular\u201d and \u201cart\u201d films to understand the ways in which they have addressed (or not) issues of mass politics, the state, and the people. You do not need a prior background in Indian films or Indian history to take this class but it is absolutely essential that you attend all the screenings and participate in class discussion.

We will explore some well-known episodes, like the emergence of Christian Science, as well as less-studied moments in the story of American religion and medicine, like the early-20th-century interest in the effect of tuberculosis on Jews. We will investigate the deep medical interests of early Methodists as well as the sometimes fraught relationship between modern medicine and Amish and Mennonite communities. This course will evaluate how religious thought and practice have interacted in different religious communities that span the history of America from European exploration to the present.

Among topics to be considered are the role that dignity and humanity play in grounding such rights, their relation to political and economic institutions, and the distinction between duties of justice and claims of charity or humanitarian aid. Finally we will consider the application of such theories to concrete, problematic and pressing problems, such as global poverty, torture and genocide. (V) (I)

It proceeds to discuss human rights in two prevailing modalities. First, it explores rights as protection of the body and personhood and the modern, Western notion of individualism. Second, it inquires into rights as they affect groups (e.g., ethnicities and, potentially, transnational corporations) or states.

V\u000aIn autumn 1914, one hundred years ago, the opening battles of the Great War were fought. They led into a four-year conflagration that is remembered as a seminal catastrophe for Europe. This course sets out to explore key aspects of this war. (1) The memory work of the last one hundred years has produced a uniquely dense record of the experience of war both at the battle front and at the home front. For budding historians this is a matchless opportunity to work with sources. (2) It is also a war that is often described as both a \u201ctotal\u201d and a \u201cglobal\u201d war, but what this entails is open to debate. For the more conceptually inclined young historian this is an opportunity to prove their theoretical mettle. (3) This war that ended peace and ushered in an "Age of Extremes" raises crucial questions about the politics of war and peace. It, thus, should be of interest for all those who consider history the school for the grand political decisions about war and peace. (4) Last but not least, World War I has been the source for a huge outpouring of memorial testimony all the way into the present. In fact, some of this memorial work will just have unfolded as we begin our class. Hence, it is an opportunity to reflect on the nature of memory and the emotional impact of grief in twentieth-century European history.

Background readings, historical texts, and visual documents have been selected in order to take advantage of the increasingly similar questions about slavery\u2019s ending that have emerged in the historical literatures of many different countries. The course therefore takes advantage of growing interdisciplinary and cross-national scholarly research about slavery and emancipations in order to compare and contrast emancipatory processes in regions of the Caribbean (especially St. Domingue/Haiti, Jamaica, Martinique, Guadeloupe, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Grenada, and Trinidad), North America (especially the United States), Brazil, and West Africa (Liberia, Sierra Leone, Ghana, and Senegal).

V\u000a\u201cHistory,\u201d as Isidore of Seville put it in his Etymologies, \u201cis a narration of things done, through which those things which were done in the past are discerned. In Greek, it is called historia, apo tou istorein, that is "to see," or "to learn by inquiring." For among the ancients no one would write history unless he had been present and had seen those things which ought to be written down. But what if you weren\u2019t there to see? The purpose of this course is to introduce students to the practice of historical research as an exercise in imagining what it was like to \u201csee\u201d the events of the past as if one were present and to narrate them so that others might \u201csee.\u201d We will consider problems of plot, character, setting, and style, as well as practice finding and interpreting the textual, architectural, geographical, and material sources at our disposal for writing \u201crealistic\u201d accounts of \u201cthings done.\u201d

V\u000aThis course looks at British history in the \u201clong seventeenth century," ranging from the accession of Elizabeth I in 1558 to the end of the Stuart dynasty in 1714. The period was one of upheaval, extraordinary both in itself and in its lasting consequences. The country saw protracted civil conflict, a king put on trial and executed, and (arguably) two revolutions. Its culture was distinguished by figures such as Shakespeare, Milton, Newton, Locke, and Purcell. And it created the origins of a world empire, as well as pursuing radical developments in economics, politics, and experimental science. We shall explore aspects of this period, using selected primary and secondary sources to introduce the history and historiography of early modern English culture.

Yet science continues to pose questions that are challenging and, in some instances, troubling. How will our technologies affect the environment? Should we prevent the cloning of humans? Can we devise a politically acceptable framework for the patenting of life? Such questions make it vitally important that we try to understand what science is and how it works, even if we never enter labs. This course uses evidence from controversies (e.g., Human Genome Project, International Space Station) to throw light on the enterprise of science itself.

How should a history of sexuality take into account scientific theories, social relations of power, and different experiences of the self? We discuss the contrasting descriptions and conceptions of sexual behavior before and after the emergence of a science of sexuality. Other writers influenced by and critical of Foucault are also discussed. (A)

V\u000aThis course will examine the relationship between moving images, particularly motion-picture films, and the human sciences broadly construed, from the early days of cinema to the advent of fMRI. It will use primary source documents alongside screenings to allow students to study what the moving image meant to researchers wishing to develop knowledge of mind and behavior\u2014what they thought film could do that still photography, and unmediated human observation, could not. The kinds of motion pictures we will study will vary widely, from infant development studies to psychiatric films, from documentaries to research films, and from films made by scientists or clinicians as part of their laboratory or therapeutic work, to experimental films made by seasoned film-makers. We will explore how people used the recordings they made, in their own studies, in communications with other scientists, and for didactic and other purposes. We will also discuss how researchers' claims about mental processes\u2014perception, memory, consciousness, and interpersonal influence\u2014drew on their understandings of particular technologies.

V\u000aMedia ecology examines how the structure and content of our media environments\u2014online and offline, in words, images, sounds, and textures\u2014affect human perception, understanding, feeling, and value; or alternatively, media ecology investigates the massive and dynamic interrelation of processes and objects, beings and things, patterns and matter. At stake are issues about agency\u2014human or material\u2014and about determinism\u2014how does society or culture interact with or shape its technologies, or vice versa? This course investigates theories of media ecology by exploring systems of meanings that humans embody (cultural, social, ecological) in conjunction with the emerging field of software studies about the cultural, political, social, and aesthetic impacts of software (e.g., code, interaction, interface). In our actual and virtual environments, how do we understand performing our multiple human embodiments in relation to other bodies (organism or machine) in pursuit of social or political goals?

How do our capabilities for communication inform our databases and social networks, and likewise, how do emergent machine functionalities influence our technogenesis as we learn not only to think and do things with digital media, but also to learn with them? In relation to myths, games, rituals, and dreams of learning, we examine kinesthetic as well as inter- and intra-personal intelligences in human embodiment and their digital replication, with a focus less on information than on meaning and ideologies.

V\u000aOne can distinguish four ways in which science and aesthetics are related during the last three centuries. First, science has been the subject of artistic effort in painting and photography and in poetry and novels (e.g., in Goethe\u2019s poetry or in H. G. Wells\u2019s Island of Doctor Moreau). Second, science has been used to explain aesthetic effects (e.g., Helmholtz\u2019s work on the way painters achieve visual effects or musicians achieve tonal effects). Third, aesthetic means have been used to convey scientific conceptions (e.g., through illustrations in scientific volumes or through aesthetically affective and effective writing). Finally philosophers have stepped back to consider the relationship between scientific knowing and aesthetic comprehension (e.g., Kant and Bas van Fraassen). In this course, we will consider these four modes of relationship. The first part of the quarter will be devoted to Kant, reading carefully his third critique; then we will turn to Goethe and Helmholtz, both feeling the impact of Kant, and to Wells, a student of T. H. Huxley. We then consider more contemporary modes expressive of the relationship, especially the role of illustrations in science and the work of contemporary philosophers like Fraassen.

V\u000aWhat can evolutionary theory tell us about economics? The link between the two disciplines was evident already in Darwin\u2019s recognition of his intellectual debt to Malthus and Smith. But the meaning of evolution in the social domain, in particular its economic and political implications, were from the outset the object of heated debates. Under the auspices of the theory of evolution the most disparate conceptions of progress, and diametrically opposed political positions were heralded in the past 150 years. Today there is still great disagreement as to how evolutionary principles can be applied to economics and what practical conclusions we can gain from understanding them.

V\u000aThe wellbeing of individuals depends on sociocultural as well as psychobiological conditions, yet current professional thinking about mental health and illness focuses almost exclusively on psychobiological factors. Mental health is influenced significantly by the levels and types of environmental support and of stress that persons experience in their social milieus, which differentially affect their individual strengths and vulnerabilities. This course aims to broaden our concepts of positive mental health by examining the contributions of major social scientific theorists, such as Durkheim, Freud, Simmel, Weber, Mead and other classic and recent writers whose works demonstrate the vital connection between individual personality and sociocultural context. The course will consist of lectures and discussion of readings, with grades based on short paper assignments. (D; 4)

On a conceptual level, the course will invite students to think through the complex relationships between categories of knowledge and clinical technologies (in this case, mainly psychiatric ones) and the subjectivities of persons living with mental illness. Put in slightly different terms, we will look at the multiple links between psychiatrists' professional accounts of mental illness and patients' experiences of it. Readings will be drawn primarily from medical and psychological anthropology, cultural psychiatry, and science studies, but will include some "primary texts" from the memoiristic and psychiatric literatures.

We discuss: the properties of human languages (spoken and signed) as systems of communication distinct from other forms (including animal and artificial systems), whether some languages are more primitive than others, how language is acquired, used, changes, and evolves, what it means to be bilingual. Typical texts used include Plato's Cratylus, parts of Finnegans Wake, Locke, Truffaut's L'enfant sauvage, Turing.

V\u000aThese seminars introduce students to the analysis and practice of expert academic writing. Experts must meet many familiar standards for successful writing: clear style, logical organization, and persuasive argument. But because they work with specialized knowledge, experts also face particular writing difficulties: they must be clear about complexities and specific about abstractions; they must use uncomplicated organization for very complicated ideas; they must create straightforward logic for intricate arguments; they must be concise but not incomplete, direct but not simplistic; they must clarify the obscure but not repeat the obvious; and they must anticipate the demands of aggressively skeptical readers. The seminars do not repeat or extend the substantive discussion of the Humanities class; they use the discussions and assignments from those classes as a tool for the advanced study of writing. We study various methods not only for the construction of sophisticated and well-structured arguments but also for understanding the complications and limits of those arguments. These seminars also address issues of readership and communication within expert communities. As students present papers in the seminars, we can use the reactions of the audience to introduce the techniques experts can use to transform a text from one that serves the writer to one that serves the readers.

V\u000aThinking about the nature of wisdom goes back to Aristotle and has changed in many ways over the history of thought. However, in modern times the term "wisdom" has appeared less in popular discourse except as a synonym for being "smart" or "clever." This course examines the basic question of how wisdom has been defined and how the definition has changed. We examine whether wisdom really exists or whether it is simply a creation of mythology or fiction or wishful thinking. Further, the course considers whether and how wisdom can be studied scientifically, that is, how it can be measured and experimentally manipulated. Readings are drawn from philosophy, classics, history, behavioral economics, neuroscience, and psychology. In addition to considering the theoretical concept of wisdom and how it can be studied scientifically, the course explores how concepts of wisdom can be applied in business, education, medicine, and the law. We conclude by discussing the notion of how practical wisdom can be applied in daily life to increase human flourishing.

This course investigates cultural logics of how one of our more recent machines\u2014the digital computer\u2014provides reciprocal models between people and their machines, such as robots, laptops, smart phones, the internet. How do our capabilities for communication inform our databases and social networks, and likewise, how do emergent machine functionalities influence our technogenesis as we learn not only to think and do things with digital media, but also to learn with them? In relation to myths, games, rituals, and dreams of learning, we examine kinesthetic as well as inter- and intra-personal intelligences in human embodiment and their digital replication, with a focus less on information than on meaning and ideologies.

V\u000aThis course is a foundational overview of key global questions and challenges of globalization and globalness. The first course in a 2-course sequence, it is designed for International Studies majors. The course proceeds thematically, stringing together many themes that usually comprise the domain of \u201cglobal\u201d affairs, events, items, organizations, trends, and phenomena. The course also unfolds theoretically and empirically, rooting theoretical propositions in some concrete historical, geographic, and cultural locations. Investigation of global entails attention to local, as well as to some concepts that are not so easy to site\u2014flows, dynamics, or trends\u2014and terrains that are only tentatively geographical: regional, transnational, cosmopolitan, ideological, virtual, planetary. Thus, a parallel task of the course will be to inquire: how do we study global, how do we grasp the local, and what are the means of observing, assessing, qualifying, and quantifying all intermediate spaces and categories that make up contemporary life on multiple scales of existence? At the heart of our course exploration is existence under the global condition, and we will be wondering about human life in the light of contemporary challenges and opportunities: new technologies and diseases, global imagination and mass consumption, nation-states and emergencies that transcend borders, and enduring histories.

V\u000aThis course is the second part of a two-course sequence designed for students majoring in International Studies with two objectives in mind. First, in the vein of Introduction to Contemporary Global Issues 1 (CGI-1), the course continues to explore concepts, processes, and phenomena that constitute \u2018globalness\u2019, giving them historical depth and critical angle. Unlike CGI-I, however, this course reads closely three books while examining three broad fields of inquiry\u2014science/knowledge/technology; economy; and politics\u2014and three overlapping disciplinary approaches: anthropology, sociology, and history. Second, the course relies on the assigned texts as excellent examples of scholarship with which to elucidate the processes and challenges of academic research. We will learn, by means of these examples, how to design an academic research project. The second objective of the course, then, will be to produce a research proposal, developing in the process a better understanding of what scholarly research entails and what preliminary work needs to be done in order for a research project to proceed. The drafting of the research proposal will follow a set of the very same guidelines that will structure the writing of your BA research proposal (due to the IS at the beginning of the Spring Quarter of your third year) and your BA thesis. More generally, however, you can rely on the research framework introduced here to guide any other research endeavor, undertaken in the context of another course, a field research, or a grant proposal.

V\u000aThe course explores the lively presence of magic in the contemporary, presumably disenchanted world. It approaches the problem of magic historically\u2014examining how magic became an object of social scientific inquiry\u2014and anthropologically, attending to the magic in practice on the margins of the industrial, rational, cosmopolitan, and technological societies and economies. Furthermore, this course reads classic and contemporary ethnographies of magic together with studies of science and technology to critically examine questions of agency, practice, experience, experiment, and efficacy. The course reads widely across sites, disciplines, and theories, attending to eventful objects and alien agents, stepping into post-socialist, post-colonial, and post-secular magic markets and medical clinics, and reading for the political energies of the emergent communities that effectively mix science, magic, and technology.

I will devote particular attention to the mutual construction of archaeological interpretation and Israeli identity and to the contested role of archaeology in the public sphere both within Israeli society and in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The course will conclude with a discussion of the plausibility and possible content of an indigenous post-conflict archaeology in Israel and Palestine, based on 21st century paradigm shifts in archaeological discourse and field work.

V\u000aThis course will consider the changing function of the notion of the messiah as it developed and changed in the modern era.  It takes as its concrete starting point the Sabbatian Heresy of the 17th century and concludes with Derrida\u2019s philosophical development of the concept of the messianic. The course\u2019s aim is to use messianism as a focal point around which to consider the dynamic relationship between philosophy and Jewish civilization. It will examine the changing representations of the the Messiah within the history of Jewish civilization. Concurrently it will consider the after-effect of these representations on discourses of modernity and vice-versa, illustrating both how Enlightenment conceptions of progress helped to create the notion of \u201cmessianism\u201d understood as an abstract idea, and how the modern/post-modern philosophical conception of the \u201cmessianic\u201d as a force that interrupts time is dependent upon historical studies of the messianic dimension of traditional Judaism.

V\u000aThe class will discuss the connections between Israeli history and Jewish history. We will explore the history of the state since its establishment, its intellectual elites, their cultural production, as well as the protests, demonstrations, and sit-ins organized by Israeli Jews in Israel during the years 1948-2012. The class will reflect on tensions between Israelis of different origins, Mizrahi, Ashkenazi and Ethiopian communities in particular, and will discuss whether the arrival of various communities of Jews to Israel signified a liberating exodus from an oppressive  exile; we will therefore consider different periodizations of Israeli history in which the moment of arrival to Israel of various migrants/\u2019olim (like Holocaust survivors, Mizrahi Jews, and others) marked the beginning of a difficult journey, aimed at achieving social mobility and citizenship rights in the Jewish state. We will also look at conflicts based on religion, especially the encounters between Haredi, national-religious and secular Jews in Israel. Finally, we will explore Israel\u2019s relations with its Palestinian citizens and the Palestinian subjects in the occupied West Bank. The class will consider instances of politicized violence in Israel, and reflect on the ways in which their analysis could inform our thinking about social identities, nationalism, and religiosity. We will try to read against, and beyond, national Zionist narratives; unpack many national silences regarding the social and economic tensions embodied in these events, and study their implications with respect to visions of pluralism, binationalism, integration, and nationalism in Israel.

V\u000aThe Hebrew Bible is the most important intertextual point of reference in Modern Hebrew literature, a literary tradition that begins with the (sometimes contested) claim to revive the ancient language of the Bible. In this course, we will consider the Bible as a source of vocabulary, figurative language, voice and narrative models in modern Hebrew and Jewish literature, considering the stakes and the implications of such intertextual engagement. Among the topics we will focus on: the concept of language-revival, the figure of the prophet-poet, revisions and counter-versions of key Biblical stories (including the story of creation, the binding of Isaac and the stories of King David), the Song of Songs in Modern Jewish poetry.

V\u000aThis course will address the thousand-year evolvement of post-Biblical Judaism from a Temple and Land orientation to the emergence of Rabbinic Judaism. The first section of the course will focus on the political and cultural effects of the Hellenistic and early Roman periods on Jews and Judaism, with a stress placed not only on the social and political developments in Judea but on the early stages and subsequent growth of Jewish diaspora communities as well. In this context special attention will be given to the variegated literary corpus produced by Jews both in Judea and the diaspora. The second section will analyze the changes in Jewish life and self-identity in the aftermath of the destruction of Jerusalem and the Second Temple in 70CE, and the gradual emergence of Rabbinic Judaism as an alternative expression of Jewish religious commitment. The Roman Empire's embracing of Christianity on the one hand, and the growing assertiveness of a Babylonian Rabbinic community on the other, will also be closely examined.

V\u000aAlthough this course assumes that students have full mastery of the grammatical and lexical content at the intermediate level, there is a shift from a reliance on the cognitive approach to an emphasis on the expansion of various grammatical and vocabulary-related subjects. After being introduced to sophisticated and more complex syntactic constructions, students learn how to transform simple sentences into more complicated ones. The exercises address the creative efforts of students, and the reading segments are longer and more challenging in both style and content. The language of the texts reflects the literary written medium rather than the more informal spoken style, which often dominates the introductory and intermediate texts.

We will learn to observe and describe different kinds of artifacts, made in a broad array of media (painting, sculpture, urban form, photography, engraving, and drawing, among others) to explicate the social context in which they were produced and circulated. By taking into account their constant dialogue with European ideas and models, we will analyze how colonial encounters, national formations, and cultural exchange took place in the region, and how identity, ethnicity, politics, and the sacred have been depicted in different historical moments. No background in art history or in Latin America is required for this course.

V\u000aConvivencia is a word that describes the multicultural and social environment created by the existence of Muslim, Christian, and Jewish communities in medieval Spain. This course aims to examine both this circumstance and its social memory: how and why contemporary narratives have dealt with this historical issue, usually portrayed as a mirror or a precedent for present day situations in which different religious and cultural communities share the same political and social arena. The course is conceived as a dialogue between the past and the present, between the evidence from remote times and the conflicting perceptions, interpretations, and misconceptions that are built upon this evidence. In so doing, the objective is to address a number of pressing questions regarding the uses and abuses of history, its role as forger of identities, communities, or values, and, more particularly, the difficult relations of contemporary Spain with its own past.

V\u000aThe focus of this course will be the reading of works which deal, in one way of another, with "coming of age under colonialism" in Africa, the Caribbean, South Asia, and Southeast Asia.  Some are autobiographies in the normal sense, other are works of fiction, and many fall in between.  Most are colonial but some are literally postcolonial. The focus will be upon themes of developing a personal identity in negotiation between a local culture and a dominant colonial one, with formal schooling as a major common site.  There are obviously major issues of "postcoloniality" as stake her, in a mixture of political and cultural terms which we ourselves will need to negotiate.  The two weekly session will normally(but not always) be divided between a lecture, which will introduce the historical context and author, and a discussion of the assigned text.  Additional texts will be suggest both for background reading and potential paper topics.

It explains the principles of modern intellectual property, by examining their historical development over the last five hundred years. Using sources from the history of literature, art, and music\u2014as well as from modern science and information technology\u2014students will discover how piracy and property have clashed since the Renaissance, and still do so today. They will then be well-placed to address the central problem of intellectual property, and one of the most basic questions facing today's universities: What is the proper relation between creativity and commerce?

V\u000a'Information' in all its forms is perhaps the defining phenomenon of our age. But although we tend to think of it as something distinctively modern, in fact it came into being through a long history of thought, practice, and technology. This course will therefore suggest how to think historically about information. Using examples that range from the Middle Ages to the twenty-first century, we shall explore how different societies have conceptualized the subject, and how they have sought to control it. We shall address how information has been collected, classified, circulated, contested, and destroyed. The aim is to provide a different kind of understanding of information practices\u2014one that can be put to use in other historical inquiries, as well as casting an unfamiliar light on our own everyday lives.

This course concerns itself with the various ways people have striven to understand the American South, past and present. We read fiction, autobiography, and history (including meditations on how to write history). Main themes of the course include the difference between historical scholarship and writing history in fictional form; the role of the author in each, and consideration of the interstitial space of autobiography; the question of authorial authenticity; and the tension between contemporary demands for truthfulness and the rejection of "truth."

V\u000aTheories about the ownership of one human being by another have played a crucial role in structuring some of the primary concepts of political philosophy, including freedom, property, and consent. What anthropological, moral, and economic assumptions supported pro-slavery arguments? What social and intellectual conditions were necessary for the institution of slavery to be rejected by some political thinkers, and what philosophical arguments did anti-slavery thinkers make? How does slavery differ from other forms of subjection, and how is it related to other social and political institutions and practices? This seminar examines these and other questions by studying (among others) Aristotle, the sixteenth-century debate about Amerindian slavery in the New World, Montesquieu, Rousseau, Diderot, the writings of eighteenth-century anti-slavery activists, and nineteenth-century American debates.

V\u000aThe mutual constitution of liberal political thought and modern European empires has been the subject a vibrant new body of work in both political theory and the history of political thought over the past two decades. The evolution of liberal thought coincided and intersected with the rise of European empires, and those empires have been shaped by liberal preoccupations, including ideas of tutelage in self-government, exporting the rule of law, and the normativity of European modernity. Some of the questions this course will address include: how was liberalism, an apparently universalistic and egalitarian theory, used to legitimate conquest and imperial domination? Is liberalism inherently imperialist? Are certain liberal ideas and doctrines (progress, development, liberty) particularly compatible with empire? What does, or what might, a critique of liberal imperialism look like? Readings will include historical works by authors such as Mill, Tocqueville, and Hobson, as well as contemporary works of political theory and the history of political thought (by authors such as James Tully, Michael Ignatieff, David Kennedy, and Uday Mehta).

The West has embodied the American dream; it has also represented an American nightmare. This course will examine the changing definitions, demographics, conceptualizations, and significance of the nineteenth-century North American West.

Our emphasis throughout will be on how social historical and political forces shaped and were shaped in turn by twentieth-century science.

V\u000aThis is where modern America begins. Before there was a Great Recession or an Occupy Wall Street, there was the nineteenth-century roller coaster of prosperity and panic, the robber barons and newfound workers' unions of the Gilded Age; the passionate public debates over the central bank, monetary policy, and the national currency. Before the Tea Party, the Founders themselves debated over which ways to make their Revolution realized, enduring, and meaningful in daily interactions as well as institutions. To understand the debates over the recently concluded Iraq War, we must return to the origins of American imperialism in the 1800s. To appreciate the significance and symbolism of the first African-American president, we have to revisit the nation's long history of slavery, racism, and segregation. The nineteenth-century survey will examine the experiences and the conflicts that made up the history of modern American society, as it unfolded over the course of the 1800s. Weather permitting, the class will take at least one short trip to relevant historical site in (or around) Chicago. Requirements include careful reading, active and thoughtful participation, and a series of short written assignments.

This is a history class that situates itself within a robust interdisciplinary conversation. Students can expect to engage works of autobiography and poetry, sociology, documentary photography, and political science as well as more straightforward historical analysis.

V\u000aHumanitarianism in its most general form is an ethics of benevolence and sympathy extending universally and impartially to all human beings. Humanitarians understand the world as an affective community and insist that the world can be transformed and, if not transformed, suffering and ill-treatment can be alleviated by fearless vanguards of compassion. Lately, the entire concept has come under attack as deceptive, fraudulent, and useless. If anything, so it is argued, humanitarianism has failed, if it has not actively worsened humanitarian crises. Humanitarians promise relief and deliver a mess; they consort with the worst abusers of human rights; they have never changed anything. Well, one of the questions we will ask is what we make of this critique in light of the historical record. What do humanitarians do? What is their effect and when and where are they effective? Is it true that abolitionists have achieved the abolition of slavery? What about the struggle for social justice? About famine relief? About refugee aid? However, rather than chasing one case after another, we will focus on the humanitarian rationale for action and how it differs from other such rationales, say, Pacifist, Marxist, or liberal rights-based approaches.

V\u000aThe post\u2013Cold War world has been seen a proliferation of so-called humanitarian interventions as well as of doctrines and agreements that guide them. R2P, the Responsibility to Protect, is the most prominent example for the latter.  What do we make of these interventions for humanitarian ends? Should we denounce their backers as covert imperialists or their detractors as callous fellow-travelers for genocidaires? Should we give up humanitarian reasoning? There is no self-evident answer. However, there is quite a bit of material to work with. First of all, why this sudden rush toward humanitarian intervention? How do these interventions relate to the older (Cold War) history of (UN) peacekeeping? Second, forced humanitarian interventions have a surprisingly long history that makes a difference, if we want to understand the present. This is a history of interstate protection for (religious) minorities, a history of muscular, imperial meddling in other people's and, especially, in the Ottoman Empire's affairs, a history not least of securitizing relief operations, and only eventually a history of protecting against humanitarian and human rights abuses. In all of these instances it is a history of legitimating violence as the lesser evil in the face of grievous abuses and man-made disasters, which would suggest that the future of global politics is not with peacekeeping, but with internationally sanctioned warmaking.

V\u000aThis course examines the causes, characteristics, and effects\u2014economic, social, and otherwise\u2014of the "industrious" and industrial revolutions. The course reviews an array of unresolved debates, among them the so-called Brenner debate and the debates over proto-industrialization, the enclosure movements, the sources of technological innovation, path dependence and diffusion patterns within and across economies, the family economy, the standard of living, the formation of the middle and working classes, the consequences of literacy, and the voluntary initiatives and public policies addressing such social problems as poverty, disease, illegitimacy, and crime. The course is the first in a two-course sequence covering the economic and social history of Europe from 1700 to the present, but each course is free-standing\u2014students enrolled in this course are not required to take its sequel.

V\u000aThe mutual constitution of liberal political thought and modern European empires has been the subject a vibrant new body of work in both political theory and the history of political thought over the past two decades. The evolution of liberal thought coincided and intersected with the rise of European empires, and those empires have been shaped by liberal preoccupations, including ideas of tutelage in self-government, exporting the rule of law, and the normativity of European modernity. Some of the questions this course will address include: how was liberalism, an apparently universalistic and egalitarian theory, used to legitimate conquest and imperial domination? Is liberalism inherently imperialist? Are certain liberal ideas and doctrines (progress, development, liberty) particularly compatible with empire? What does, or what might, a critique of liberal imperialism look like? Readings will include historical works by authors such as Mill, Tocqueville, and Hobson, as well as contemporary works of political theory and the history of political thought (by authors such as James Tully, Michael Ignatieff, David Kennedy, and Uday Mehta).

It is structured around a political history narrative, but we will examine events from a wide range of perspectives\u2014legal, intellectual, social, economic, diplomatic, military, religious. The course is not encyclopedic, nor is it focused on mastering facts (although this is not discouraged). It is rather concerned with "big" questions about American history since ca. 1900, including the role and scope of government and the rights and obligations of citizens.

V\u000aThere have been two successful slave revolts in world history. One of them\u2014which unfolded between 1791 and 1804 in the French colony of Saint Domingue (also variously referred to as San Domingo, Santo Domingo in English) on the western portion of the island that the Spanish had called Hispaniola (Espanola)\u2014developed sufficient socio-political force to form a new state government that its ex-slave founders called Haiti. This course explores the Haitian revolution as critical to the examination of slave emancipation colonialism, comparative revolutions, and postcolonial governance and sovereignty. It especially aims to explore interpretive debates that explicitly (or implicitly) link the problems of slave emancipation to the contradictions of modern freedom. Course readings draw on historical, anthropological, and political studies, selected published documents, and historical fiction to think critically about ways of extending how this history and its implications have been explored.

It proceeds to discuss human rights in two prevailing modalities. First, it explores rights as protection of the body and personhood and the modern, Western notion of individualism. Second, it inquires into rights as they affect groups (e.g., ethnicities and, potentially, transnational corporations) or states.

We look at which populations have the most access to technology-based information sources (the digital divide), and how individual and group identities are being forged online. We ask how is the responsiveness of government being affected, and how representative is the online community. Severe conflict over the tension between national security and individual privacy rights in the U.S., United Kingdom and Ireland will be explored as well. We analyze both modern works (such as those by Turkle and Gilder) and the work of modern democratic theorists (such as Habermas). (B)

Through this debate, which has been sometimes explicit and at other times sub-rosa, we will probe the meanings and significance attributed to race, culture, and their interrelationship. Among the topics to be addressed in lectures and discussions are the debates on the relation between slave culture and resistance, the contrasting ways black and white performers have engaged the minstrel tradition, the social interpretations of black musical expression, the role to the state in promoting black cultural expression, and culture as a site of resistance.  Each topic will be addressed through lectures and class discussions.

V\u000aMedia ecology examines how the structure and content of our media environments\u2014online and offline, in words, images, sounds, and textures\u2014affect human perception, understanding, feeling, and value; or alternatively, media ecology investigates the massive and dynamic interrelation of processes and objects, beings and things, patterns and matter. At stake are issues about agency\u2014human or material\u2014and about determinism\u2014how does society or culture interact with or shape its technologies, or vice versa? This course investigates theories of media ecology by exploring systems of meanings that humans embody (cultural, social, ecological) in conjunction with the emerging field of software studies about the cultural, political, social, and aesthetic impacts of software (e.g., code, interaction, interface). In our actual and virtual environments, how do we understand performing our multiple human embodiments in relation to other bodies (organism or machine) in pursuit of social or political goals?

In most democracies, the distribution of wealth among citizens is unequal but the right to vote is universal. Why then have so many newly democratic states transitioned under conditions of high inequality yet failed to redistribute? This course explores this puzzle by analyzing the mechanisms through which individual and group preferences can be translated into pro-poor policies, and the role elites play in influencing a government's capacity or incentives to redistribute wealth. Topics include economic inequality and the demand for redistribution, the difference in redistribution between democracy and dictatorship, the role of globalization in policymaking, and the effects of redistribution on political stability and change.

V\u000a The aim of this undergraduate course is to examine the emergence of cultural rights within the broader human rights movement. Indeed, cultural or ethnic rights were part of a third generation of human rights which moves beyond purely civil and political rights, to definitions that include social, economic and cultural rights. Among the many rights embedded in the notion of cultural rights are the rights to political and cultural autonomy, natural resources, and territory, typically for indigenous peoples. In this course, we analyze how these cultural rights emerged in international human rights institutions and discourse, as well as how they have been translated back into, and transformed by, local political struggles around the world. Throughout the course, the students will have the chance to learn from and engage with a number of organizations and activists in Chicago that work on indigenous and cultural rights. (C)

V\u000aThe Basque language is spoken in the Basque Country, a region in Northeastern Spain and Southwestern France. It is a language isolate: As far as we know, it is not related to any other language in the world. This course offers an introduction to reading, writing, and speaking in Basque. The teaching methodology will take on a communicative perspective\u2014we will work on vocabulary, comprehension, and communicative skills in pragmatic and strategic ways. Students will acquire basic Basque language skills that will enable them to master the communicative functions which have been set for the course. The lessons will have a sense of continuity, and, in that context, the main aim will be for the students to witness and take command of their own progress.

The module uses a task-based approach to learning Basque. By means of this methodology, the accumulation of task cycles promotes the acquirement of communicative goals. We will work on different tasks on each lesson, and the progressive build-up of those tasks will cause the gradual improvement of the students\u2019 communicative skills and overall fluency. By the end of the quarter the student should be able to produce grammatically accurate short texts in Basque, interact with speakers of Basque at a basic level while employing a variety of complex cases and tenses, understand a range of basic written and oral texts in Basque, and understand a range of cases and the differences between them.

V\u000aThe Basque language is spoken in the Basque Country, a region in Northeastern Spain and Southwestern France. It is a language isolate: As far as we know, it is not related to any other language in the world. This course offers an introduction to reading, writing, and speaking in Basque. The teaching methodology will take on a communicative perspective\u2014we will work on vocabulary, comprehension, and communicative skills in pragmatic and strategic ways. Students will acquire basic Basque language skills that will enable them to master the communicative functions which have been set for the course. The lessons will have a sense of continuity, and, in that context, the main aim will be for the students to witness and take command of their own progress.

V\u000aA continuation of Elementary Basque I, advancing the students\u2019 knowledge of grammatical structure and their receptive, expressive, and conversational skills. The module uses a task-based approach to learning Basque. By means of this methodology, the accumulation of task cycles promotes the acquirement of communicative goals. We will work on different tasks on each lesson, and the progressive build-up of those tasks will cause the gradual improvement of the students\u2019 communicative skills and overall fluency. By the end of the quarter the student should be able to produce grammatically accurate short texts in Basque, interact with speakers of Basque at a basic level while employing a variety of complex cases and tenses, understand a range of basic written and oral texts in Basque, and understand a range of cases and the differences between them.

Looking at the structure of language means understanding what phonemes, words, and sentences are, and how each language establishes principles for the combinations of these things and for their use; looking at the use of language means understanding the ways in which individuals and groups use language to declare their social identities and the ways in which languages can change over time. The overarching theme is understanding what varieties of language structure and use are found across the world's languages and cultures, and what limitations on this variety exist.

By \u201cmeaning\u201d we refer to the (for the most part, logical) content of words, constituents, and sentences (semantics), and by \u201cuse\u201d we intend to capture how this content is implemented in discourse and what kinds of additional dimensions of meaning may then arise (pragmatics). Some of the core empirical phenomena that have to do with meaning are introduced: lexical (i.e., word) meaning, reference, quantification, logical inferencing, presupposition, implicature, context sensitivity, cross-linguistic variation, speech acts. Main course goals are not only to familiarize students with the basic topics in semantics and pragmatics but also to help them develop basic skills in semantic analysis and argumentation.

In order to understand the development of Proto-Slavic into the existing Slavic languages and dialects, we focus on a set of basic phenomena. The course is specifically concerned with making students aware of factors that led to the breakup of the Slavic unity and the emergence of the individual languages. Drawing on the historical development, we touch upon such salient typological characteristics of the modern languages such as the rich set of morphophonemic alternations, aspect, free word order, and agreement.

How is it gendered? How does it frame the narrative or drive it forward? How does language subvert or undermine the visual representation of sex? What does any of this tell us about gender, sexuality and erotics in non-pornographic contexts? Course readings focus on theories of pornographic representation, theories of language, gender and erotics, and methods of transcribing and analyzing dialogue. The course requires students to watch a wide range of pornography, including different varieties of straight, gay and trans porn, so anyone enrolling in the course must be interested in pornography as a social and cultural phenomenon and must also have experience watching porn and thinking about it.

V\u000aThis course is designed for undergraduate and graduate students who are interested in East Asian languages and in learning or teaching East Asian languages. In this class, we will address significant issues in learning and teaching an East Asian language through key concepts in second language acquisition (SLA) and the analysis of the linguistic characteristics of Korean, Japanese, and Chinese. In particular, we will discuss the internal processes of acquisition to begin addressing the (pedagogical) issues pertinent to teaching and learning specific linguistic structures of the East Asian languages. Hence, each week, students will do readings in SLA as well as academic papers for each language on a given topic. For a comparative approach and perspective of the East Asian language and society, we will explore several linguistic and sociolinguistic issues common to the three languages that underlie the linguistic diversity and similarities of East Asia, such as the use of Chinese characters or the development and use of honorifics in China, Japan, and Korea. Such an approach will also allow us to analyze the language influence and interaction among the three languages and how that shapes the culture, society, and language use. The objectives of this course are as follows: (i) to gain a basic knowledge of the structures of East Asian Languages; (ii) to gain a basic understanding of the key theories and concepts in second language acquisition and teaching methodology; and lastly (iii) to gain new insight on East Asian history, culture, and society through the analysis of Chinese, Korean, and Japanese language.

Throughout the course, we will consider how the built environments and artifacts produced by an incredible diversity of peoples and places can make visible larger trends of historical, political, and cultural change.

Despite their spiritual function, icons also drew attention to their materiality by erupting into life\u2014bleeding, weeping, and attacking foes. In this course, we will combine the study of Byzantine images with Byzantine primary sources (in translation) to explore a range of topics related to the icon, including medieval image theory, iconoclasm, visuality, enshrinement, the copy, and materiality. Our investigation of Byzantine images will be enhanced through comparison with responses to the image in Islam, Judaism, and the Christian west.

V\u000aThe central focus of this course will be Michelangelo\u2019s prolific production in sculpture, painting, and architecture while making substantial use of his writings, both poetry and letters, and his extensive extant body of preparatory drawings to help us understand more about his artistic personality, creative processes, theories of art, and his intellectual and spiritual biography, including his changing attitudes towards Neoplatonism, Christianity, and politics. Our structure will be roughly chronological starting with his highly precocious juvenilia of the 1490s in Florence at the court of Lorenzo the Magnificent through his death in Rome in 1564 as an old man who was simultaneously already the deity of art and a lonely, troubled, repentant Christian, producing some of his most moving works in a highly personal style. Beyond close examination of the works themselves, among the themes that will receive considerable attention for the ways they bear upon his art are Michelangelo\u2019s fraught relationship with patrons such as the Medici and a succession of popes; his complex devotion to and rivalry with ancient classical art and his living rivalry with Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Bramante, and others; his changing attitude towards religion, especially his engagement with the Catholic Reform and some of its key personalities such as Vittoria Colonna; his sexuality and how it might bear on the representation of gender in his art and poetry; his \u201cofficial\u201d biographies created by the devotees Giorgio Vasari (1550, 1568) and Ascanio Condivii (1553) during Michelangelo\u2019s lifetime and some of the most influential moments in the artist\u2019s complex, sometimes ambivalent, reception over the centuries; new approaches and ideas about Michelangelo that have emerged in recent decades from the unabated torrent of scholarship and, especially, the restoration and scientific imaging of many of his works. Through the concentrated art-historical material studied, the course will take seriously the attempt to introduce students with little or no background in art or art history to some of the major avenues for interpretation in this field, including formal, stylistic, iconographical, psychological, social, feminist, theoretical, and reception. Readings are chosen with this diversity of approach in mind.

V\u000aThe Mongol Conquest of Baghdad and the Islamic east in 1258 deepened cultural divisions between the eastern and western Islamic lands to an unprecedented degree. Under the Mongol Ilkhans in the Islamic east, artists and architects combined familiar and newly introduced visual forms to negotiate their place in a radically altered new world order. Under the Mamluk sultans in the Islamic west, artists and architects visually asserted the Mamluks' special claim to legitimacy as the defenders of Islam who had stopped the Mongol advance. And yet, artists, architects and objects moved frequently between Mongol and Mamluk courts, complicating what at first appears to be a simple dichotomy between experimental and traditionalist visual cultures in the eastern and western regions of the Islamic world in this period. Students will write research papers on topics chosen in consultation with the instructor.

Since Chaucer\u2019s writings consistently foreground questions of who is \u201cspeaking\u201d in his writing, we will take \u201cliterary voice\u201d as our guiding heuristic, and examine relationships between speech, writing, translation, and dramatis personae. The class will read works from Chaucer\u2019s lyrics, dream visions, and Canterbury Tales. (C, E)

V\u000aThis course is first of all a close reading of Marsilio Ficino\u2019s seminal book On Love (first Latin edition De amore 1484; Ficino\u2019s own Italian translation 1544). Ficino\u2019s philosophical masterpiece is the foundation of the Renaissance view of love from a Neo-Platonic perspective. It is impossible to overemphasize its influence on European culture. On Love is not just a radically new interpretation of Plato\u2019s Symposium. It is the book through which sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Europe read the love experience. Our course will analyze its multiple classical sources and its spiritual connotations. During our close reading of Ficino\u2019s text, we will show how European writers and philosophers appropriated specific parts of this Renaissance masterpiece. In particular, we will read extensive excerpts from some important love treatises, such as Castiglione\u2019s The Courtier (Il cortigiano), Leone Ebreo\u2019s Dialogues on Love, Tullia d\u2019Aragona\u2019s On the Infinity of Love, but also selections from a variety of European poets, such as Michelangelo\u2019s canzoniere, Maurice Scève\u2019s Délie, and Fray Luis de León\u2019s Poesía.

V\u000aWritten in the midst of the social disruption caused by the Black Death (1348), the Decameron may have held readers attention for centuries because of its bawdiness, but it is also a profound exploration into the basis of faith and the meaning of death, the status of language, the construction of social hierarchy and social order, and the nature of crisis and historical change. Framed by a storytelling contest between seven young ladies and three young men who have left the city to avoid the plague, the one hundred stories of Boccaccio\u2019s Decameron form a structural masterpiece that anticipates the Renaissance epics, Chaucer\u2019s Canterbury Tales, and the modern short story.

V\u000aThis class is an inquiry into the medieval romance genre through the close and comparative reading of one of its oldest extant representatives, Gorgâni\u2019s Vis & Râmin (c. 1050). With roots that go back to Late Antiquity, this romance is a valuable interlocutor between the Greek novel and the Ovidian erotic tradition, Arabic love theory and poetics, and well-known European romances like Tristan, Lancelot, and Cligès: a sustained exploration of psychological turmoil and moral indecision, and a vivid dramatization of the many contradictions inherent in erotic theory, most starkly by the lovers' faithful adultery. By reading Vis & Râmin alongside some of its generic neighbors (Kallirrhoe, Leukippe, Tristan, Cligès), as well as the love-theories of writers like Plato, Ovid, Avicenna, Jâhiz, Ibn Hazm, and Andreas Cappellanus, we will map out the various kinds of literary work the romance is called upon to do, and investigate the myriad and shifting conceptions of romantic love as performance, subjectivity, and moral practice. An optional section introducing selections from the original text in Persian will be available if there is sufficient student interest.

This course considers the many ways in which medieval Europeans used and thought about animals: from the horses, hawks, and hounds of the hunt to the sheep, cows, chickens, and pigs of the home, as well as the lambs, doves, and lions of Holy Scripture, the talking foxes and cats of the beast fable, and the unicorns and dragons of saints\u2019 lives, beastiaries, and travelers\u2019 tales. Topics and questions to be addressed include the economic and social importance of animals, the symbolism of animals, animals in law, science, philosophy, and art, and whether animals were believed to have feelings and/or souls.

In this course, we will be following this medieval curriculum insofar as we are able through some of its primary texts, many only recently translated, so as to come to a better appreciation of the way in which the study of these arts affected the development of medieval European intellectual and artistic culture.

In addition, the repertories of Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Sri Lanka, as well as states and nations bordering the region, are covered.

Students are also encouraged, through readings and listening, to contextualize rock within a broad field of popular/vernacular music making in the twentieth century.

V\u000aFew questions in ethnomusicology and music history remain as enigmatic and yet ideologically charged as, What is Jewish music? With responses ranging from claims that Jewishness defies representation with music to those that argue for a plurality possible only when Jewish culture appropriates the musics of constantly shifting historical contexts, Jewish music has acquired remarkably important resonance in the history of religions and in the meaning of modernity. In this proseminar we approach the richness and diversity of Jewish music as givens and as starting points for understanding of both the sacred and the secular in Jewish culture. The cultural contexts and soundscapes of Jewish music, thus, are not isolated, restricted, for example, to the synagogue or ritual practice, but rather they cross the boundaries between traditions, genres, and even religions. The sound materials and structures of Jewish music, say, the modal ordering of Arabic classical music that is standard for biblical cantillation in Israel, will be treated as complex phenomena that both influence and are influenced by the worlds around Jewish communities. Genres and musical practices will be examined in their full diversity, and we shall move across the repertories of liturgical, folk, art, and popular music.

We also explore the relevance of the theoretical models to music outside of the high-modernist canon, including some jazz. The course provides an opportunity to confront some foundational questions regarding what it means to "theorize about music."

V\u000aIn July 2015, the Bavarian State Opera in Munich will present the world premiere of a piece tentatively titled Jephta's Daughter, to be directed by Saar Magal (choreographer and director, Tel Aviv) and conceived by Magal in collaboration with University of Chicago professor David Levin. Magal and Levin will offer a laboratory course in which to prepare the piece. As presently conceived, the piece will combine theater, dance, oratorio, film, contemporary composition, and a variety of contemporary performance idioms to adapt and interrogate the story of Jephta's daughter (in the Book of Judges, from which the story is adapted, she remains nameless). We are hoping to attract students keen to explore a broad cross-section of materials through seminar-style discussion and experimentation on stage. (We will work through biblical criticism, films like Harmony Korine's Spring Breakers (2013) or Ulrich Seidl's Paradise: Love-Faith-Hope, operas like Mozart's Idomeneo, oratorios like Handel's Jephta and Carissimi's Jephta, and a range of critical theory, including Rene Girard's Violence and the Sacred and Derek Hughes's Culture and Sacrifice). Stage work will encompass improvisational, physical, and text-based work. Students with an interest in any of the following are especially welcome: adaptation, theater practice, performance theory, dramaturgy, design, and/or editing.

While a conventional historical account would map the tensions between absorption and distanciation as a one-way trip, moving from absorption (in Wagner) to distanciation (as coined by Brecht) to distraction (as deployed by Kluge), we will explore how each artist deploys each term to varying effects. Works to be considered include Wagner's The Flying Dutchman and Parsifal, Brecht's Man Is Man and The Measures Taken, and Kluge's Yesterday Girl and The Power of Emotions. Readings by each artist, as well as by Theodor Adorno, Walter Benjamin, Michael Fried, Miriam Hansen, Andreas Huyssen, and Gertrud Koch. In English.

V\u000aThis course surveys the art and architecture of the Islamic world from 1100 to 1500. In that period, political fragmentation into multiple principalities challenged a deeply rooted ideology of unity of the Islamic world. The course of the various principalities competed not only in politics but also in the patronage of architectural projects and of arts (e.g., textiles, ceramics, woodwork, arts of the book). While focusing on the central Islamic lands, we consider regional traditions from Spain to India and the importance for the arts of contacts with China and the West.

Each of these multi-religious, multi-linguistic, multi-ethnic empires developed styles of art and architecture that expressed their own complex identities. Further, they expressed their complex relations with each other through art and architecture. The various ways in which contact with regions beyond the Islamic world throughout this period impacted the arts will also be considered.

The poetic trope whereby a visually pleasing object or site is compared to the garden of paradise is equally ubiquitous. But does this imply any historical consistency in the significance of garden imagery, of actual gardens, or of the poetic trope? In this class we explore this question by examining both garden imagery and actual gardens from many different times and places in the Islamic world. How do their visual forms and cultural significance shift according to specific historical circumstances?

V\u000aThough they did not compose a \u201cmulti-cultural society\u201d in the modern sense, the ruling elite and subjects of the vast Ottoman Empire came from a wide variety of regional, ethnic, linguistic, and religious backgrounds. The dynamics of the Empire\u2019s internal cultural diversity, as well as of its external relations with contemporary courts in Iran, Italy, and elsewhere, were continuously negotiated and renegotiated in its art and architecture. This course examines classical Ottoman architecture, arts of the book, ceramics, and textiles. Particular attention is paid to the urban transformation of Byzantine Constantinople into Ottoman Istanbul after 1453, and to the political, technical, and economic factors leading to the formation of a distinctively Ottoman visual idiom disseminated through multiple media in the sixteenth century.

I will devote particular attention to the mutual construction of archaeological interpretation and Israeli identity and to the contested role of archaeology in the public sphere both within Israeli society and in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The course will conclude with a discussion of the plausibility and possible content of an indigenous post-conflict archaeology in Israel and Palestine, based on 21st century paradigm shifts in archaeological discourse and field work.

The course\u2019s aim is to use messianism as a focal point around which to consider the dynamic relationship between philosophy and Jewish civilization. It will examine the changing representations of the the Messiah within the history of Jewish civilization. Concurrently it will consider the after-effect of these representations on discourses of modernity and vice-versa, illustrating both how Enlightenment conceptions of progress helped to create the notion of \u201cmessianism\u201d understood as an abstract idea, and how the modern/post-modern philosophical conception of the \u201cmessianic\u201d as a force that interrupts time is dependent upon historical studies of the messianic dimension of traditional Judaism.

V\u000aThe class will discuss the connections between Israeli history and Jewish history. We will explore the history of the state since its establishment, its intellectual elites, their cultural production, as well as the protests, demonstrations, and sit-ins organized by Israeli Jews in Israel during the years 1948-2012. The class will reflect on tensions between Israelis of different origins, Mizrahi, Ashkenazi and Ethiopian communities in particular, and will discuss whether the arrival of various communities of Jews to Israel signified a liberating exodus from an oppressive  exile; we will therefore consider different periodizations of Israeli history in which the moment of arrival to Israel of various migrants/\u2019olim (like Holocaust survivors, Mizrahi Jews, and others) marked the beginning of a difficult journey, aimed at achieving social mobility and citizenship rights in the Jewish state. We will also look at conflicts based on religion, especially the encounters between Haredi, national-religious and secular Jews in Israel. Finally, we will explore Israel\u2019s relations with its Palestinian citizens and the Palestinian subjects in the occupied West Bank. The class will consider instances of politicized violence in Israel, and reflect on the ways in which their analysis could inform our thinking about social identities, nationalism, and religiosity. We will try to read against, and beyond, national Zionist narratives; unpack many national silences regarding the social and economic tensions embodied in these events, and study their implications with respect to visions of pluralism, binationalism, integration, and nationalism in Israel.

In this course, we will consider the Bible as a source of vocabulary, figurative language, voice and narrative models in modern Hebrew and Jewish literature, considering the stakes and the implications of such intertextual engagement. Among the topics we will focus on: the concept of language-revival, the figure of the prophet-poet, revisions and counter-versions of key Biblical stories (including the story of creation, the binding of Isaac, and the stories of King David), the Song of Songs in Modern Jewish poetry.

We likewise explore the ways in which archeologists, historians, novelists, and artists emphasized the connectivity between past and present, and the channels through which their new ideas were transmitted. The class thus highlights phenomena like nationalism, reform, and literary and print capitalism (in both Hebrew and Arabic) as experienced in the Middle East.

The first section of the course will focus on the political and cultural effects of the Hellenistic and early Roman periods on Jews and Judaism, with a stress placed not only on the social and political developments in Judea but on the early stages and subsequent growth of Jewish diaspora communities as well. In this context special attention will be given to the variegated literary corpus produced by Jews both in Judea and the diaspora. The second section will analyze the changes in Jewish life and self-identity in the aftermath of the destruction of Jerusalem and the Second Temple in 70CE, and the gradual emergence of Rabbinic Judaism as an alternative expression of Jewish religious commitment. The Roman Empire's embracing of Christianity on the one hand, and the growing assertiveness of a Babylonian Rabbinic community on the other, will also be closely examined.

V\u000aThis class is an inquiry into the medieval romance genre through the close and comparative reading of one of its oldest extant representatives, Gorgâni\u2019s Vis & Râmin (c. 1050). With roots that go back to Late Antiquity, this romance is a valuable interlocutor between the Greek novel and the Ovidian erotic tradition, Arabic love theory and poetics, and well-known European romances like Tristan, Lancelot, and Cligès: a sustained exploration of psychological turmoil and moral indecision, and a vivid dramatization of the many contradictions inherent in erotic theory, most starkly by the lovers' faithful adultery. By reading Vis & Râmin alongside some of its generic neighbors (Kallirrhoe, Leukippe, Tristan, Cligès), as well as the love-theories of writers like Plato, Ovid, Avicenna, Jâhiz, Ibn Hazm, and Andreas Cappellanus, we will map out the various kinds of literary work the romance is called upon to do, and investigate the myriad and shifting conceptions of romantic love as performance, subjectivity, and moral practice. An optional section introducing selections from the original text in Persian will be available if there is sufficient student interest.

V\u000aThis course will take a trip around the Roman Empire, exploring the different motivations and contexts for travel in Antiquity. Through surviving literary texts we will survey varieties of travel, including military campaigns, scientific exploration, conquest, commerce and piracy, economic displacement, pilgrimage, and even tourism. Stops in different provinces of the Empire will provide geographical information as well as details about the practicalities of travel: vessels, caravans and other means, cost of travel, infrastructure at the traveler\u2019s disposal, maritime and land routes, safe-conducts, guidebooks and language aids for the traveler. Along the way, the course will also provide an introduction to the diversity and uniformity of the Roman Empire.

The topics that will be covered include not only the practicalities of death (funerary rituals, legal aspects of death like wills and inheritance), but also beliefs and myths of the afterlife, magical rituals such as necromancy, the impact of Christianization on Roman understandings of death, and later Christian developments like the cult of the saints.

While the princes of these courts were of Turkic and/or Mongol origin, they adopted many of the cultural and artistic expectations of Perso-Islamicate court life. Further, many objects and monuments patronized by these courts belong to artistic histories variously shared with non-Islamic powers from the Byzantine Empire to China. Questions of how modern scholars have approached and categorized the arts and architecture of these courts will receive particular attention. Each student will write a historiographic review essay with a research component.

V\u000aThe course will take up a number of themes that are central to Wittgenstein\u2019s Tractatus as they arise in the history of philosophical thought about logic\u2014themes that arise out of questions such as the following: What is the status of the basic law(s) of logic? Is it possible to draw a limit to logical thought? What is the status of the reflecting subject of logical inquiry? What is the relation between the logical and the psychological? What, if anything, is the relation between the following two inquiries into forms of unity: \u201cWhat is the unity of the judgment (or the proposition)?" and \u201cWhat is the unity of the judging subject?\u201d What (if any) sort of distinction between form and matter is relevant to logic? How should one understand the formality of logic? How, and how deeply, does language matter to logic? Topics will include various aspects of Aristotle's logical theory and metaphysics, Descartes\u2019s Doctrine of the Creation of Eternal Truth, Kant on Pure General and Transcendental Logic, Frege on the nature of a proper Begriffsschrift and what it takes to understand what that is, and early Wittgenstein\u2019s inheritance and treatment of all of the above. Secondary readings will be from Jan Lukasiewicz, John MacFarlane, Clinton Tolley, Sebastian Roedl, Matt Boyle, John McDowell, Elizabeth Anscombe, Cora Diamond, Peter Geach, Matthias Haase, Thomas Ricketts, and Peter Sullivan.

In the second portion of the class we will consider one pressing injustice in our society in light of our previous philosophical conclusions. Possible candidates include, but are not limited to, racial inequality, economic inequality, and gender hierarchy. Here our goal will be to combine our philosophical theories with empirical evidence in order to identify, diagnose, and effectively respond to actual injustice. (A)

In metaphysics, these questions will include: What is time? What is the best account of personal identity across time? Do we have free will? We will also discuss how the construction of a theory of knowledge ought to relate to the construction of a metaphysical theory\u2014roughly speaking, what comes first, epistemology or metaphysics?

Are death and pre-birth metaphysically symmetrical?) and the ethical questions raised by death (Is death a misfortune\u2014something we should fear or lament? Should we be glad not to be immortal? How should we understand the ethics of abortion and capital punishment?) Our exploration of these issues will take us through the work of many figures in the Western philosophical tradition (Plato, Augustine, Descartes, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Heidegger), but we will be concentrating on the recent and dramatic flowering of work on the subject.

V\u000aRecently, a number of best-selling books by professional philosophers like Daniel Dennett (Breaking the Spell), scientists like Richard Dawkins (The God Delusion), and popular writers like Sam Harris (The End of Faith) have argued that modern science shows that religious faith is fundamentally irrational. This argument has not gone unanswered (for example, by Francis Collins in The Language of God and by Pope Benedict XVI in his Regensburg lecture). This course will examine the relationship between religious faith and reason. We will discuss four positions: (1) reason and faith are in conflict, and it is best to abandon science in favor of faith (religious fundamentalism); (2) reason and faith are in conflict, and it is best to abandon faith in favor of science (scientific atheism); (3) reason and faith do not make cognitive contact, and one can freely choose faith without conflict with reason ("non-overlapping magisteria," fideism); (4) reason and faith do make cognitive contact but are mutually supporting, not in conflict (harmonious compatibilism). We will focus on contemporary debates but also consider their historical roots (for example, Aquinas, Leibniz, Voltaire, Hume, William James). Among the topics to be discussed will be the nature of reason and faith, arguments for and against the existence of God, the problem of evil, evolution and intelligent design, cosmology and the origin of the universe, the rationality of belief in miracles and the supernatural, and evolutionary and neuroscientific explanations of religious belief and religious experience.

V\u000aThe aim of this course is to introduce one of the most important and discussed works pertaining to the continental field of philosophy of the 20th century: Heidegger's Being and Time. The course is structured by two main movements. On the one hand we introduce the main and fundamental concepts developed by Heidegger in his work through analytic sessions devoted to the most important sections of Sein und Zeit. On the other hand, we follow the way Sein und Zeit was received and discussed in the field of French contemporary continental philosophy, especially through Derrida's and Levinas's interpretations and discussions of Sein und Zeit. The double structure of our itinerary obeys a philosophical necessity which takes the form of a leading question: Is it possible to think beyond the primacy of the horizon of Being\u2014drawn by Heidegger in Sein und Zeit\u2014anything like an "Otherwise than Being"? And if so, we will have to elucidate why and in what sense such an alternative horizon of sense does not entail the abandonment of the Heideggerian Question of Being, but leads, on the contrary, to the full explanation of the background without which the Question of Being raised by Sein und Zeit becomes unintelligible.

V\u000aThe question how thought and speech refers, and in particular what role descriptions play in a comprehensive philosophical analysis of referring expressions, has played an outstanding role in 20th century philosophy and remains influential until today. In this class we will trace the discussion about the relation between reference and description from Fregean beginnings to the most recent two-dimensionalist attempts to overcome Kripke\u2019s seminal arguments against descriptive analyses of referring expressions. Throughout, we will try to reach a better understanding of why questions about reference and description are of foundational importance for a range of topics that are central to philosophical theorizing, including the analysis of propositional attitudes such as belief and knowledge, the nature of possibility and necessity, the question of whether there is a level of mental experience that is epistemically transparent, the relation between thought and language, the role of the principle of compositionality in semantics, and the intersection between semantics and pragmatics.

V\u000aAre our moral and religious values eternal and unchanging or were they shaped by contingent historical events in the distant past? If the latter is the case, did these events leave traces in our psychology in a manner which is not immediately obvious and accessible to us, but which could nevertheless become accessible? What would be the implications of such historical and psychological influences for our moral and religious values: Might we need to reassess, and perhaps radically alter, all or some of our moral and religious beliefs? In this course we will discuss Friedrich Nietzsche\u2019s and Sigmund Freud\u2019s original answers to these questions. In the first part of the course, we will examine Nietzsche\u2019s project of criticizing morality and religion, especially via a close reading of his Genealogy of Morals. We will discuss such themes as his genealogical account of Christian morality, the development and moralization of our conscience through religion, and will to power and the nature of truth. We will also consider broader explanatory and normative issues, such the scope and ambitions of Nietzsche\u2019s critique of morality and its meta-ethical implications. In the second part of the course, we will read most of Freud\u2019s cultural texts, such as Totem and Taboo, The Future of an Illusion, Civilization and Its Discontents, and Moses and Monotheism, and discuss his genealogical accounts of morality and religion and their complex relations to human psychology. Throughout our discussion, we will be concerned with Freud\u2019s notion of the unconscious and models of the psyche, as well as with the transition from individual to group psychology. Finally, we will also critically assess the status and plausibility of Nietzsche\u2019s and Freud\u2019s respective accounts: Are these two philosophers telling us factual historical stories, mere psychological stories, or a combination of both? In order to answer these questions, we will read works by leading philosophers and psychoanalysts, as well as passages from Scripture.

V\u000aOne can distinguish four ways in which science and aesthetics are related during the last three centuries. First, science has been the subject of artistic effort in painting and photography and in poetry and novels (e.g., in Goethe\u2019s poetry or in H. G. Wells\u2019s Island of Doctor Moreau). Second, science has been used to explain aesthetic effects (e.g., Helmholtz\u2019s work on the way painters achieve visual effects or musicians achieve tonal effects). Third, aesthetic means have been used to convey scientific conceptions (e.g., through illustrations in scientific volumes or through aesthetically affective and effective writing). Finally philosophers have stepped back to consider the relationship between scientific knowing and aesthetic comprehension (e.g., Kant and Bas van Fraassen). In this course, we will consider these four modes of relationship. The first part of the quarter will be devoted to Kant, reading carefully his third critique; then we will turn to Goethe and Helmholtz, both feeling the impact of Kant, and to Wells, a student of T. H. Huxley. We then consider more contemporary modes expressive of the relationship, especially the role of illustrations in science and the work of contemporary philosophers like Fraassen.

How should a history of sexuality take into account scientific theories, social relations of power, and different experiences of the self? We discuss the contrasting descriptions and conceptions of sexual behavior before and after the emergence of a science of sexuality.

V\u000aThis course will focus on authors from the Jewish tradition, although some attention will be given to Catholic and Protestant perspectives, as found, for example, in liberation theology and in certain forms of religious existentialism. We will look at the various ways in which contemporary philosophers of Judaism have dealt with suffering, evil and God, especially after the experience of the Shoah. We will examine the often repeated claim that Judaism has approached the philosophical and religious challenges of suffering more through an ethics of suffering than on the basis of a metaphysics of suffering. After an introductory discussion of Maimonides on the Book of Job, readings for the course may come from authors such as E. Lévinas, J.B. Soloveitchik, Y. Leibowitz, H. Jonas, A. Lichtenstein, D.W. Halivni, D. Shatz, and E. Berkovits. The course will culminate in a philosophical analysis of some of the most important writings of Primo Levi.

V\u000aThis class will be a close reading of Plato\u2019s Phaedo, which is a dialogue about  what it means to die, and what kinds of things escape death. In addition to interesting ourselves in the\u2014dramatic and philosophical\u2014structure of the dialogue as a whole, we will carefully examine each of Socrates\u2019 arguments for the immortality of the soul. We will also read some contemporary philosophical literature both on the Phaedo itself and on the problem of the afterlife. (IV)

V\u000aThis course attempts to provide a broad survey of German philosophy from the time of Kant into the 19th century. This course is an introduction to German Idealism, through readings of Kant\u2019s first and second Critiques, Fichte\u2019s Vocation of the Scholar, and Hegel\u2019s Phenomenology of Spirit. We will focus especially on the concept of \u201crecognition\u201d and examine why for Kant and Fichte the social recognition\u2014the recognition of the Other as a free agent\u2014becomes intelligible thanks to practical reason. Once this background is clarified, we will then discuss Hegel\u2019s famous \u201cMaster-Slave Dialectic\u201d and try to explain the meaning of the so-called \u201cstruggle for recognition\u201d in the economy of the Phenomenology of Spirit.

How do languages relate to each other? What is metaphor? What is fiction? The focus will be on classic work in the analytic tradition (Frege, Russell, Wittgenstein, Carnap, Tarski, Quine, Austin, Grice, Davidson, Donnellan, Putnam, Searle, Kaplan, Kripke) but we will also read, and relate to this modern work, some current work in the philosophical literature and some seminal discussions of language in the writings of Plato and Aristotle.  (II)

V\u000aKey contemporary debates in the philosophical literature often rely on formal tools and techniques that go beyond the material taught in an introductory logic class.A robust understanding of these debates\u2014and, accordingly, the ability to meaningfully engage with a good deal of contemporary philosophy\u2014requires a basic grasp of extensions of standard logic such as modal logic, multi-valued logic, and supervaluations, as well as an appreciation of the key philosophical virtues and vices of these extensions. The goal of this course is to provide students with the required logic literacy. While some basic metalogical results will come into view as the quarter proceeds, the course will primarily focus on the scope (and, perhaps, the limits) of logic as an important tool for philosophical theorizing.

V\u000aTopic: Language and Skepticism. In this course we will examine attempts to solve the problem of philosophical skepticism through reflection on the nature of linguistic meaning. We will focus on three such attempts: early 20th-century logical empiricism, mid-20th-century ordinary-language philosophy, and the contemporary movement of epistemological contextualism. In each case, we will ask whether the claims advanced about the nature of language can be sustained, and whether they really do have the power to defeat the skeptical challenge.

V\u000aWe examine the cause and effects of Earth's great ice ages, and use the knowledge so gained as a means to inform ourselves about the stability of Earth's climate system and its relationship to the life of humankind. The ice age also serves as the starting point for the exploration of Earth's history through deep time undertaken in PHSC 11000. The lab exercises deal with topographic maps that depict glacial landforms in various national parks such as Yosemite National Park in California and Glacier National Park in Montana. We also explore the glacial landforms in the Chicago vicinity through topographic maps and a day-long field trip. A day-long weekend field trip to ice-age sites is required. If a weekend date is not possible, the field trip will be run on the Wednesday prior to Thanksgiving recess. Students who register for this class must arrange to attend the field trip at one of the offered dates. (L)

For example, it will examine the physical processes that make stars the only objects in the Universe that can synthesize heavy elements, like all the atoms in your body. It will explain why some stars have winds, and why some stars retire to an old age of relaxation and cooling down while some of them blow up in the most spectacular manner. In order to do this, we will take as our starting point the diagram made in the early 20th century by Hertzsprung and Russell, which plotted the color of stars as a function of their brightness, and, through lectures and discussions, follow the subsequent developments in physics that helped us to unlock the secrets encoded therein.

V\u000aThis seminar will examine the development of the concept of power as a psychological principle in Hobbes, Spinoza, and Nietzsche. The moderns give unprecedented significance to the notion of power, especially making it a central term of analysis for moral psychology and political philosophy. What is power? In what sense do human beings desire power, and is this desire good or bad? Does an inclination to power come from the passions or reason? What is the importance of scientific or theological meanings of power for the psychological-political concept? We will consider the relation between the modern notion of power and classical liberal understandings of natural right, liberty and equality, the sovereign state, and war and peace. What is achieved, theoretically and politically, by explaining human phenomena through a concept of power, and what is sacrificed?

This course considers the origins of mass opinion about politics and public policy, including the role of core values and beliefs, information, expectations about political actors, the mass media, economic self-interest, and racial attitudes. This course also examines problems of political representation, from the level of political elites communicating with constituents, and from the possibility of aggregate representation. (B)

Must a just society be a democracy? What economic arrangements are compatible with justice? In the second portion of the class we will consider one pressing injustice in our society in light of our previous philosophical conclusions. Possible candidates include, but are not limited to, racial inequality, economic inequality, and gender hierarchy. Here our goal will be to combine our philosophical theories with empirical evidence in order to identify, diagnose, and effectively respond to actual injustice. (A)

V\u000aThis course is a first course in empirical research as it is practiced across a broad range of the social sciences, including political science. It is meant to enable critical evaluation of statements of fact and cause in discussions of the polity, economy, and society. One aim is to improve students' ability to produce original research, perhaps in course papers or a senior thesis. A second objective is to improve students' ability to evaluate claims made by others in scholarship, commentary, or public discourse. The specific research tools that the course develops are statistical, but the approach is more general. It will be useful as a guide to critical thinking whether the research to be evaluated, or to be done, is quantitative or not. Above all, the course seeks to demonstrate the use of empirical research in the service of an argument. (A)

We look at which populations have the most access to technology-based information sources (the digital divide), and how individual and group identities are being forged online. We ask how is the responsiveness of government being affected, and how representative is the online community. Severe conflict over the tension between national security and individual privacy rights in the U.S., United Kingdom and Ireland will be explored as well. We analyze both modern works (such as those by Turkle and Gilder) and the work of modern democratic theorists (such as Habermas). (B)

V\u000aThe invention of the nation was a particularly difficult task in Latin America. This project developed amidst brutal processes of colonization, nascent independence struggles and economies largely based on slave labor. As such, elites in this region had the monumental task of inventing a homogeneous national culture and identity in the face of ethno-racial divisions, a reality of increasingly entangled and racially mixed households, and perhaps most importantly, in the context of the rise of scientific racism. While the U.S. shares many aspects of this history with Latin America and the Caribbean, there are some important differences in the racial trajectories of these regions. The primary objective of this undergraduate course is to analyze the relationship between race, national identity in Latin America and the Caribbean. (C)

This course considers how Indonesia has managed to establish a surprisingly stable democratic regime since the late 1990s after more than forty years of dictatorship. What allowed democracy to take root in Indonesia despite the enormous challenges of a devastating economic crisis, violent outbreaks of ethnic and religious conflict, widespread movements for territorial separation, longstanding disagreements over the proper role for Islam in politics, and an apparent lack of local democratic experience? What were the tradeoffs involved, and how have they affected the quality of democracy in Indonesia today? Beyond surveying the important case of Indonesia itself, this course will also consider how Indonesia\u2019s surprising experience might change the way we think about democratization more generally.

In most democracies, the distribution of wealth among citizens is unequal but the right to vote is universal. Why then have so many newly democratic states transitioned under conditions of high inequality yet failed to redistribute? This course explores this puzzle by analyzing the mechanisms through which individual and group preferences can be translated into pro-poor policies, and the role elites play in influencing a government's capacity or incentives to redistribute wealth. Topics include economic inequality and the demand for redistribution, the difference in redistribution between democracy and dictatorship, the role of globalization in policymaking, and the effects of redistribution on political stability and change.

Developmental psychopathology is a field that lies at the interface of clinical and developmental psychology within which the aim is to identify the earliest deviations from normative developmental processes that likely lead to the development of psychopathology. By incorporating the study of basic biological and psychological processes into the study of psychopathology, the identification of earliest markers, and ultimately causal factors, may be achieved.

V\u000aThere is a substantial portion of the psychological nature of human beings that is neither homogeneous nor fixed across time and space. At the heart of the discipline of cultural psychology is the tenet of psychological pluralism, which states that the study of "normal" psychology is the study of multiple psychologies and not just the study of a single or uniform fundamental psychology for all peoples of the world. Research findings in cultural psychology thus raise provocative questions about the integrity and value of alternative forms of subjectivity across cultural groups. In this course we analyze the concept of "culture" and examine ethnic and cross-cultural variations in mental functioning with special attention to the cultural psychology of emotions, self, moral judgment, categorization, and reasoning.

V\u000aThinking about the nature of wisdom goes back to Aristotle and has changed in many ways over the history of thought. However, in modern times the term "wisdom" has appeared less in popular discourse except as a synonym for being "smart" or "clever." This course examines the basic question of how wisdom has been defined and how the definition has changed. We examine whether wisdom really exists or whether it is simply a creation of mythology or fiction or wishful thinking. Further, the course considers whether and how wisdom can be studied scientifically, that is, how it can be measured and experimentally manipulated. Readings are drawn from philosophy, classics, history, behavioral economics, neuroscience, and psychology. In addition to considering the theoretical concept of wisdom and how it can be studied scientifically, the course explores how concepts of wisdom can be applied in business, education, medicine, and the law. We conclude by discussing the notion of how practical wisdom can be applied in daily life to increase human flourishing.

V\u000aThis course aims to provide undergraduate students with a broad, yet comprehensive survey of music\u2019s impact in cognitive, developmental, and social psychology. Lectures, assignments, and course readings will focus on both theoretical and empirical accounts of how music\u2014used as a natural lens\u2014can provide us with insights about basic psychological processes. We will also frequently compare music to other forms of communication (i.e., language), in order to discuss whether the mechanisms used to perceive and understand music are domain-specific or domain-general. Specific issues that will be addressed throughout the course include: Why can music so easily elicit emotional responses from listeners? Does music have its own grammar? How does learning a musical system affect our cognitive, social, and neural development? No previous knowledge of music theory is assumed. Given that a majority of the readings are from empirical journals, however, previous course work in statistics and research methods is suggested.

V\u000aWe constantly make decisions, determine our preferences, and choose among alternatives. The importance of our decisions range from ordering a meal at a restaurant to choosing what college to attend. How do we make such decisions? What are the rules that guide us and the biases that shape our decisions? What determines our preferences? What impacts our willingness to take risks? In this course we consider how the way we go about gathering information affects our judgment, and how the way we frame problems affects our perceptions and shapes the solutions to problems. We learn what governs choice and the systematic way it deviates from normative rules. We consider how we think about the future and how we learn from the past. The course focuses on the psychology behind making decisions with implications for a wide range of areas such as public policy, law, and medicine.

V\u000aThe goal of this course is to introduce students to the literature on early child development and explore how an understanding of core developmental concepts can inform social policies. This goal will be addressed through an integrated, multidisciplinary approach. The course will emphasize research on the science of early child development from the prenatal period through school entry. The central debate about the role of early experience in development will provide a unifying strand for the course. Students will be introduced to research in neuroscience, psychology, economics, sociology, and public policy as it bears on questions about \u201cwhat develops?\u201d, critical periods in development, the nature vs. nurture debate, and the ways in which environmental contexts (e.g., parents, families, peers, schools, institutions, communities) affect early development and developmental trajectories. The first part of the course will introduce students to the major disciplinary streams in the developmental sciences and the enduring and new debates and perspectives within the field. The second part will examine the multiple contexts of early development to understand which aspects of young children\u2019s environments affect their development and how those impacts arise. Throughout the course, we will explore how the principles of early childhood development can guide the design of policies and practices that enhance the healthy development of young children, particularly for those living in adverse circumstances, and thereby build a strong foundation for promoting equality of opportunity, reducing social class disparities in life outcomes, building human capital, fostering economic prosperity, and generating positive social change. In doing so, we will critically examine the evidence on whether the contexts of children\u2019s development are amenable to public policy intervention and the costs and benefits of different policy approaches.

V\u000aNegotiation is ubiquitous in interpersonal interactions, from making plans for a trip with friends or family, to determining working conditions with an employer, to managing international conflicts. In this course we examine the structure of different negotiations and the psychology that governs the processes and outcomes of a negotiation. For instance, we consider the role of perceptions, expectations, intuitions, and biases. We evaluate the role of information processing, modes of communication, and power in influencing a negotiated outcome. We see how the psychology of trust, reciprocity, fairness, cooperation, and competition can affect our ability to benefit from an exchange or contribute to the escalation of conflict. To better understand the dynamics of the negotiation process, we learn both through engaging in a variety of negotiation role-plays and relating these experiences to research findings.

Students will also spend significant time on developing individual research papers. We will begin in the first two weeks with an overview of the field of child psychopathology and the diagnostic systems most commonly used in the practice of child psychiatry. We will then spend the next three weeks looking at two of the most common and controversial diagnoses applied to children in the United States: Autism-spectrum disorders and Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder. In examining these categories we will consider the cultural and historical contexts that have lead to the emergence of these diagnoses and the variety of experiences of those identified as being afflicted with these disorders. The highly public controversy over giving children psychiatric medication and the implications of exporting Western psychiatric knowledge about children to other cultural contexts will also be considered. In the second half of the class we will move away from examinations of psychiatric nosology to think more broadly about the ways in which concepts of the normative treatment and behavior of children vary across time and place, looking particularly at the effects of aggression on children.

V\u000aThe connections between environment, agriculture, and food are inherent in our social, cultural, and economic networks. Land use, natural resource management, energy balances, and environmental impacts are all important components in the evolution of agricultural systems. Therefore it is important to develop ways in which to understand these connections in order to design effective agricultural programs and policies. This course is designed to provide students with guidance on the models and tools needed to conduct an economic research study on the intersecting topics of environment, agriculture, and food. Students learn how to develop original research ideas using a quantitative and applied economic policy analysis for professional and scholarly audiences. Students collect, synthesize, and analyze data using economic and statistical tools. Students provide outcomes and recommendations based on scholarly, objective, and policy relevant research rather than on advocacy or opinions, and produce a final professional-quality report for a workshop presentation and publication.

V\u000aThe goal of this class is to equip undergraduates to publish quantitative research papers and to prepare quantitative BA papers. Public policy analysts use logistic and linear regression to build models that help them understand, and thus change, the world. In preparation for building these models, factor analysis is a tool to identify underlying patterns in the data and reduce its complexity. Cluster analysis permits segmenting the policy audience, as a guide to better targeting of interventions. In this course students select a dataset of interest to them and analyze it using these four methods, preparing the "findings" sections suitable for publication and/or BA papers. They also prepare a PowerPoint presentation suitable for either a policy or academic audience. Guest speakers from the University who have published articles using these methods discuss the practical issues in undertaking quantitative research. This class is designed to extend and build on Quantitative Methods in Public Policy (PBPL 26400).

We focus on applying public policy perspectives, as found in these seminal sources, to contemporary policy issues of interest to the class. Class members who have selected a BA topic are encouraged to apply the theoretical lenses found in the great books to strengthen the literature review/theory section of their BA paper as the product of the quarter's work.

Public policies intended to maintain and strengthen traditional racial relationships have included forced relocation, apartheid, extermination, walls, institutionalization, incarceration, segregation, ethnic cleansing, and legislated discrimination. Public policies intended to upset such traditions have included forced busing, affirmative action, the reservation of opportunities and political positions for specific castes/religions/ethnicities, and the legislated illegality of discrimination in housing and employment. Most recently in the United States, through distraction, hopelessness, indifference, neglect, the absence of good ideas, and/or the inability of advocates to compete effectively in the policy landscape, public policy has little to say about race. Even an African American president has declined to offer policy initiatives in this area. This course will examine public policy attempts to address issues of race, explore why so many seem to contain the seeds of their own failure, and formulate potential race policies that could jump start the contemporary policy conversation in this area. The course will include a research component exploring the current status of race policy in Chicago and Hyde Park.

We will review the economic tools of analysis used in public finance, including cost-benefit analysis, and apply them to government policies, largely at the federal level. The course will focus on policies to remedy externalities, the provision of public goods, social insurance, and the effects of taxes. Within social insurance, we will cover social security and health reform. We will also explore the role taxation plays in government policy. Tax topics include the effect of taxes on consumers and firms, savings and corporate decisions, and fundamental tax reform.

How do they choose their policy platforms? How do citizens form their vote choices? Who turns out to vote and why? Who is informed and why? Does it matter that many citizens abstain from politics and are uninformed? What roles do race, ethnicity, and prejudice play in elections? What role does the media play? What laws and policies could improve political participation and political representation? We will address these questions through the applications of game theory, microeconomic theory, and most importantly quantitative/statistical analysis.

V\u000aThe standard theory of rational choice exhibits explanatory power in a vast range of circumstances, including such disparate decision making environments as whether to commit a crime, have children, or seek to emigrate. Nonetheless, shortfalls from full rationality seem not to be uncommon, and are themselves, to some extent, systematic. Behavioral economics documents and tries to account for these departures from full rationality. This course looks at areas in which some modification of the traditional rational choice apparatus might most be warranted; these include decisions that unfold over time, involve low probability events, or implicate willpower. To what extent should public policy respond to shortfalls from rationality or concern itself with promoting happiness?

Students register for PBPL 29800 in Autumn Quarter and continue to work throughout Winter and Spring Quarters with a BA Seminar instructor/preceptor (and possibly faculty advisers) in revising their BA papers. The Autumn Quarter class informs students about sources, methods of research, and treatment of evidence. The instructor/preceptor of the Senior Seminar serves as a reader for the BA papers. Students may choose a faculty adviser as a second reader\u2014though second readers are not required. Outstanding BA papers can earn an honors designation. As part of the BA process, students write a policy memo that distills their BA research and, in early April, present their BA papers at the yearly Public Policy undergraduate research symposium for graduating seniors.

I will devote particular attention to the mutual construction of archaeological interpretation and Israeli identity and to the contested role of archaeology in the public sphere both within Israeli society and in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The course will conclude with a discussion of the plausibility and possible content of an indigenous post-conflict archaeology in Israel and Palestine, based on 21st century paradigm shifts in archaeological discourse and field work.

We will explore the history of the state since its establishment, its intellectual elites, their cultural production, as well as the protests, demonstrations, and sit-ins organized by Israeli Jews in Israel during the years 1948-2012. The class will reflect on tensions between Israelis of different origins, Mizrahi, Ashkenazi and Ethiopian communities in particular, and will discuss whether the arrival of various communities of Jews to Israel signified a liberating exodus from an oppressive  exile; we will therefore consider different periodizations of Israeli history in which the moment of arrival to Israel of various migrants/\u2019olim (like Holocaust survivors, Mizrahi Jews, and others) marked the beginning of a difficult journey, aimed at achieving social mobility and citizenship rights in the Jewish state. We will also look at conflicts based on religion, especially the encounters between Haredi, national-religious and secular Jews in Israel. Finally, we will explore Israel\u2019s relations with its Palestinian citizens and the Palestinian subjects in the occupied West Bank. The class will consider instances of politicized violence in Israel, and reflect on the ways in which their analysis could inform our thinking about social identities, nationalism, and religiosity. We will try to read against, and beyond, national Zionist narratives; unpack many national silences regarding the social and economic tensions embodied in these events, and study their implications with respect to visions of pluralism, binationalism, integration, and nationalism in Israel.

The course\u2019s aim is to use messianism as a focal point around which to consider the dynamic relationship between philosophy and Jewish civilization. It will examine the changing representations of the the Messiah within the history of Jewish civilization. Concurrently it will consider the after-effect of these representations on discourses of modernity and vice-versa, illustrating both how Enlightenment conceptions of progress helped to create the notion of \u201cmessianism\u201d understood as an abstract idea, and how the modern/post-modern philosophical conception of the \u201cmessianic\u201d as a force that interrupts time is dependent upon historical studies of the messianic dimension of traditional Judaism.

The first section of the course will focus on the political and cultural effects of the Hellenistic and early Roman periods on Jews and Judaism, with a stress placed not only on the social and political developments in Judea but on the early stages and subsequent growth of Jewish diaspora communities as well. In this context special attention will be given to the variegated literary corpus produced by Jews both in Judea and the diaspora. The second section will analyze the changes in Jewish life and self-identity in the aftermath of the destruction of Jerusalem and the Second Temple in 70CE, and the gradual emergence of Rabbinic Judaism as an alternative expression of Jewish religious commitment. The Roman Empire's embracing of Christianity on the one hand, and the growing assertiveness of a Babylonian Rabbinic community on the other, will also be closely examined.

V\u000aRoman religion is very rarely accorded a place of prominence in the history of religions of Late Antiquity or the modern academic study of religion. Too often when Roman religion is acknowledged it is as part of a more general picture of Greco-Roman paganism\u2019s decline in the wake of Christianity\u2019s rise to power. The purpose of this course then is to consider how we might understand Roman religion as a discrete yet dynamic set of discourses, practices, communities, and institutions in the contexts of both the late antique religious world and the modern academic study of religion. To this end, this course will introduce students not only to the basic elements of Roman religious life, but also to the dominant scholarly models used to engage the ancient sources. Finally, at a more theoretical level, this course also will challenge students to think critically about how religion as a modern analytic category may or may not be useful in understanding ancient cultures.

V\u000aThis course is designed to clarify and test the assumptions underlying the present state of knowledge about the Protestant Reformation. Its method consists of reading extensively in the historiography and reflecting intensively on the issues raised by that reading. So as to maintain a well-defined focus the course is limited largely to the Reformation in Germany. So as to develop a broad perspective the course is not limited to the most recent literature. We will begin with some of the most famous older interpretations (Hegel, Ranke, Engels, Troeltsch, Weber, Febvre). We will then go on to consider the redefinition of the historical agenda since the 1960s and the current state of our knowledge by reading the work of leading contemporary historians of the Reformation (e.g., Bernd Moeller, Thomas Brady, Heiko Oberman, Jean Delumeau, Peter Blickle, Heinz Schilling). I will focus on explaining the readings, but I will also leave room for questions and discussion.

V\u000aRecently, a number of best-selling books by professional philosophers like Daniel Dennett (Breaking the Spell), scientists like Richard Dawkins (The God Delusion), and popular writers like Sam Harris (The End of Faith) have argued that modern science shows that religious faith is fundamentally irrational. This argument has not gone unanswered (for example, by Francis Collins in The Language of God and by Pope Benedict XVI in his Regensburg lecture). This course will examine the relationship between religious faith and reason. We will discuss four positions: (1) reason and faith are in conflict, and it is best to abandon science in favor of faith (religious fundamentalism); (2) reason and faith are in conflict, and it is best to abandon faith in favor of science (scientific atheism); (3) reason and faith do not make cognitive contact, and one can freely choose faith without conflict with reason ("non-overlapping magisteria," fideism); (4) reason and faith do make cognitive contact but are mutually supporting, not in conflict (harmonious compatibilism). We will focus on contemporary debates but also consider their historical roots (for example, Aquinas, Leibniz, Voltaire, Hume, William James). Among the topics to be discussed will be the nature of reason and faith, arguments for and against the existence of God, the problem of evil, evolution and intelligent design, cosmology and the origin of the universe, the rationality of belief in miracles and the supernatural, and evolutionary and neuroscientific explanations of religious belief and religious experience.

V\u000aWhat is enlightenment? How does one become enlightened, and who is enlightened? In Euro-American civilization, the eighteenth-century Age of Enlightenment championed the powers of human reason against religion and superstition to achieve scientific progress. Buddhism in the nineteenth century was represented by the heirs of Enlightenment as a religion for the Enlightenment to the point of not being a religion at all. Both traditions offer pathways to freedom (or liberation?) that draw on our rational capabilities, and both sponsor the production of knowledge that re-visions our place in the world. But they seem to be opposed: how could reason reject \u201creligious\u201d beliefs but also take part in \u201creligious\u201d traditions that aim to bring certain kinds of persons into being? We compare the mental models, discourses, methods of analysis, world-images, and practices of these traditions of enlightenment to assess the kinds of disciplines that their theoreticians and practitioners acquire and use.

V\u000aScience and religion are two ways, among many others, that people can seek to know about reality: how do we construct ordered pictures of the whole\u2014cosmos or civilization\u2014and how do we relate to them in terms of action? How do we know what we do not know, and what does that kind of \u201cknowledge\u201d mean for the orientation and direction of human existence? How would cultural biases be affected by knowing that there are others \u201cout there\u201d in the universe, should we discover them? From various perspectives, this course addresses these questions of the origins, structures, and ends of reality as we look for ourselves\u2014seek understanding of the human condition\u2014in the cosmos but also in complex religious and cultural traditions. Whereas in our popular culture, science is often identified with the realm of knowledge and religion is simply \u201cbelief\u201d or \u201cpractice,\u201d the course also seeks to trace the rational limits of science and the rational force of religion with respect to the ethical problem of the right and good conduct of human life.

We will look at the various ways in which contemporary philosophers of Judaism have dealt with suffering, evil and God, especially after the experience of the Shoah. We will examine the often repeated claim that Judaism has approached the philosophical and religious challenges of suffering more through an ethics of suffering than on the basis of a metaphysics of suffering. After an introductory discussion of Maimonides on the Book of Job, readings for the course may come from authors such as E. Lévinas, J.B. Soloveitchik, Y. Leibowitz, H. Jonas, A. Lichtenstein, D.W. Halivni, D. Shatz, and E. Berkovits. The course will culminate in a philosophical analysis of some of the most important writings of Primo Levi.

V\u000aIs love a universal theme? What constitutes a good match? To what extent are love and desire culturally constituted? This course aims to answer such questions through the stories of five famous couples in pre-modern Indian literature. These couples\u2014some divine, some human and some mixed\u2014will provide multiple perspectives on central themes in Indian culture such as love, desire, and devotion as well as on the advantages and disadvantages of being human and/or of being divine where love is concerned. Readings in this course will include translations of classical Sanskrit texts their retellings in various regional languages and a few modern adaptations.,

V\u000aIn July 2015, the Bavarian State Opera in Munich will present the world premiere of a piece tentatively titled Jephta's Daughter, to be directed by Saar Magal (choreographer and director, Tel Aviv) and conceived by Magal in collaboration with University of Chicago professor David Levin. Magal and Levin will offer a laboratory course in which to prepare the piece. As presently conceived, the piece will combine theater, dance, oratorio, film, contemporary composition, and a variety of contemporary performance idioms to adapt and interrogate the story of Jephta's daughter (in the Book of Judges, from which the story is adapted, she remains nameless). We are hoping to attract students keen to explore a broad cross-section of materials through seminar-style discussion and experimentation on stage. (We will work through biblical criticism, films like Harmony Korine's Spring Breakers (2013) or Ulrich Seidl's Paradise: Love-Faith-Hope, operas like Mozart's Idomeneo, oratorios like Handel's Jephta and Carissimi's Jephta, and a range of critical theory, including Rene Girard's Violence and the Sacred and Derek Hughes's Culture and Sacrifice). Stage work will encompass improvisational, physical, and text-based work. Students with an interest in any of the following are especially welcome: adaptation, theater practice, performance theory, dramaturgy, design, and/or editing.

In addition to the presence and movement of fictional characters within and beyond the city, we will examine the role of the city in autobiographical essays and personal writings of the authors studied. Theoretical perspectives (de Certeau, Lefebvre, Bruno, Grosz) will also be employed in light of the intersections of identity politics and urban space in the studied literary texts. Topics to be examined and debated include space and memory, marginality, urban planning and architecture, public and domestic space, linguistic identity, gaze, gender and sexuality, flânerie, homelessness, and dystopia. Authors studied may include Mercè Rodoreda, Montserrat Roig, Eduardo Mendoza, Carmen Laforet, Esther Tusquets, and Juan Marsé.

V\u000aGermaine de Staël reinvented the role of women in post-revolutionary France. She understood the Revolution like no other. Steeped in the aristocratic tradition of the salons, she was at the same time a founder of French romanticism. Her confrontation with Napoléon assumed epic proportions. From her exile in Switzerland she was, with her lover Benjamin Constant, profoundly engaged in liberal thought. Her novels are about women and for women. Her writings introduce German culture into France. In this course we will read her novels and some of her important non-fiction writings. Readings will include fiction (Corinne, Delphine) and selections from De l\u2019influence des passions, De la literature, De l\u2019Allemagne.

Comment définir l\u2019héroïsme et quelles sont ses formes ? En prenant en compte le genre littéraire et le contexte historique de chaque \u0153uvre, nous nous attacherons dans ce cours à comprendre la nécessité du héros dans la fiction, et à analyser les motifs qui le poussent à agir et le résultat de ses actions. Nous examinerons les multiples facettes du héros : des grands héros tragiques au personnage ordinaire de la deuxième moitié du XIXème siècle en passant par le héros romantique. Notre réflexion s\u2019appuiera sur une lecture précise de certaines \u0153uvres marquantes sur le sujet, écrites par des auteurs majeurs (Corneille, Voltaire, Balzac, Maupassant\u2026) et appartenant à des genres littéraires différents.

V\u000a« Toutes les fins de siècle se ressemblent » déclarait un esprit très fin-de-siècle, Karl Joris Huysmans, dans Là-bas (1891). Il faudra se demander s\u2019il en est de même pour toutes les fins de siècle dans toutes les littératures ? Quelle fin de siècle pour la littérature haïtienne qui a produit plusieurs essais historico-anthropologiques, dont De l\u2019égalité des races humaines (1885) d\u2019Anténor Firmin, Les Détracteurs de la race noire et de la république d'Haïti  (1882) et L'Égalité des races (1884) de Louis-Joseph Janvier ? Que dire de la dérobade paradoxale des premiers romanciers haïtiens qui puisaient leur sujet ailleurs que dans la réalité locale ? Le séminaire partira précisément de la publication chez Ollendorff de Thémistocle Épaminondas Labasterre,  en 1901, que l\u2019on considère pour toutes sortes de raisons comme le « premier roman haïtien » écrit par un haïtien, Frédéric Marcelin (1848-1917). Diplomate ayant vécu pendant longtemps à Paris, Marcelin invente, pour ainsi dire, une version haïtienne du réalisme. Il engage théoriquement son discours romanesque dans la représentation du quotidien, il opère un véritable changement de paradigme par rapport à une vieille perception distraite de la fiction. Marcelin publie coup sur coup deux autres romans, La Vengeance de Mama (1902) et Marilisse (1903), qui consomment la rupture de l\u2019écrivain avec le modèle esthétique postcolonial, en prônant une sorte d\u2019indigénisme qui s\u2019impose peu à peu comme la seule aspiration romanesque légitime. On tentera au cours du trimestre d'analyser la naissance du réalisme haïtien en France à la fin du XIXe siècle, en se penchant sur les trois romans de Marcelin qui semblent répondre à trois grands champs : l\u2019histoire de la langue romanesque (invention d\u2019un métissage), l\u2019histoire littéraire (influence et analogie avec le réalisme français) et l\u2019histoire politique (révolutions et mentalités).

V\u000aLes intellectuels de la Renaissance durent conceptualiser les événements qui les entouraient et penser l\u2019histoire en des termes nouveaux. La tradition et les textes de l\u2019Antiquité ne suffisaient plus pour comprendre l\u2019homme et le monde. Certains virent dans leur époque un renouveau, d\u2019autres un progrès, d\u2019autres encore un déclin, ou, comme Montaigne, un progrès dans le déclin. Bref, la Renaissance s'interroge sur sa propre histoire et offre une multitude de modèles théoriques pour sa compréhension et son écriture. A partir des textes de Machiavel, Jean Bodin, La Pope linière, Loys Le Roy, Montaigne et d\u2019autres auteurs, nous verrons comment s\u2019écrit l\u2019histoire aux débuts de la modernité.

V\u000aRédigé en 1580 et 1581, le journal de voyage en Allemagne, en Suisse et en Italie de Montaigne constitue un riche commentaire sur les pratiques politiques, religieuses et culturelles de l'Europe à la fin de la Renaissance. Ainsi, la première partie du journal de voyage met en évidence cette préoccupation politique. On a souligné que les étapes en Alsace, en Allemagne du Sud, en Suisse alémanique et en Autriche se présentaient comme une série d\u2019« impressions de voyage en Eucharistie  ». Sans aller jusqu\u2019à comparer ce voyage avec une excursion en terre cannibale ou dans le Nouveau Monde, il est pourtant vrai que Montaigne découvrit des modèles politiques fondamentalement dissemblables de ceux que la Réforme lui avait fait connaître en France. Le grand apport de ce voyage en Allemagne, Autriche et Suisse fut sans nul doute une perception de la religion plus anthropologique et politique que théologique; elle favorisa le développement d\u2019une expérience de terrain avant de rejoindre Rome. Nous verrons comment le Journal de voyage de Montaigne constitue un document politique et culturel pour Montaigne.

V\u000aThis course will explore the expression of Terror (la terreur) as it was thematized in French texts of the nineteenth century. In reaction to the fast-won freedom of 1789, an extremist group headed by Robespierre came to power and through its terroristic practices threatened the democratic values of the Revolution itself. We will examine some key moments during the period of the French Revolution and their impact on the collective memory of French novelists. Particular attention will be paid to the narrative construction of the historical moment known as the Terror, the development of the historical novel, the relationship between history and fiction.

Beginning with the crisis of naturalism in the late nineteenth century, we will consider the inflections given to literary representation by historical cataclysm, the avant-garde critique of the novel, and the postwar "age of suspicion." We will investigate the reformulations of literature's relationship to reality offered by theories of literary commitment and by the experiments of the Nouveau Roman. Finally, we will evaluate the phenomenon of the "return to the real" in contemporary French literature. Readings will include works by Aragon, Céline, Sartre, Robbe-Grillet, Sarraute, Perec, and Pierre Michon.

V\u000aThe easing of political life and the relaxation of private morals which came to characterize the long reign of Louis XV (1715\u20131774) was mirrored by the development of a new conception of art, an art more intimate, decorative, generally amorous, and often erotic. It is these last two related dimensions which are the basis of a new visual aesthetic which constitutes the subject matter of this course. Through the exploration of contemporary novels and theater, as well as contemporary critical and philosophical writings, we will demonstrate how both the sensual and the erotic become essential components of the century\u2019s cultural ethos. Artistic subjects, the mechanisms to represent them, their metaphorical stakes, and their phenomenological effects on the beholder will therefore be considered as the expression of a particular historical and ideological context. It is in this context that love became the symbol of a king who privileged peace against war, and where emotional pleasure triumphed over moralizing values and asserted itself as a new aesthetic category.

V\u000aThis class is an inquiry into the medieval romance genre through the close and comparative reading of one of its oldest extant representatives, Gorgâni\u2019s Vis & Râmin (c. 1050). With roots that go back to Late Antiquity, this romance is a valuable interlocutor between the Greek novel and the Ovidian erotic tradition, Arabic love theory and poetics, and well-known European romances like Tristan, Lancelot, and Cligès: a sustained exploration of psychological turmoil and moral indecision, and a vivid dramatization of the many contradictions inherent in erotic theory, most starkly by the lovers' faithful adultery. By reading Vis & Râmin alongside some of its generic neighbors (Kallirrhoe, Leukippe, Tristan, Cligès), as well as the love-theories of writers like Plato, Ovid, Avicenna, Jâhiz, Ibn Hazm, and Andreas Cappellanus, we will map out the various kinds of literary work the romance is called upon to do, and investigate the myriad and shifting conceptions of romantic love as performance, subjectivity, and moral practice. An optional section introducing selections from the original text in Persian will be available if there is sufficient student interest.

Framed by a storytelling contest between seven young ladies and three young men who have left the city to avoid the plague, the one hundred stories of Boccaccio\u2019s Decameron form a structural masterpiece that anticipates the Renaissance epics, Chaucer\u2019s Canterbury Tales, and the modern short story.

V\u000aThis course is first of all a close reading of Marsilio Ficino\u2019s seminal book On Love (first Latin edition De amore 1484; Ficino\u2019s own Italian translation 1544). Ficino\u2019s philosophical masterpiece is the foundation of the Renaissance view of love from a Neo-Platonic perspective. It is impossible to overemphasize its influence on European culture. On Love is not just a radically new interpretation of Plato\u2019s Symposium. It is the book through which sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Europe read the love experience. Our course will analyze its multiple classical sources and its spiritual connotations. During our close reading of Ficino\u2019s text, we will show how European writers and philosophers appropriated specific parts of this Renaissance masterpiece. In particular, we will read extensive excerpts from some important love treatises, such as Castiglione\u2019s The Courtier (Il cortigiano), Leone Ebreo\u2019s Dialogues on Love, Tullia d\u2019Aragona\u2019s On the Infinity of Love, but also selections from a variety of European poets, such as Michelangelo\u2019s canzoniere, Maurice Scève\u2019s Délie, and Fray Luis de León\u2019s Poesía.

V\u000aThis course looks at the reception of Giambattista Vico (1668\u20131744), whose philosophy, largely neglected at first, eventually came to enjoy far-reaching influence as European thinkers set out on repeated quests for the source of a different \u201cmodernity\u201d or \u201cCounter-Enlightenment\u201d in fields as varied as political theory (Romagnosi, Cattaneo, Ferrari), the historical and modernist novel (Cuoco, Manzoni, Joyce), Romantic historiography (Michelet, Gioberti), literary criticism (Auerbach), and intellectual history (Berlin). What is the secret behind the enduring appeal of Vico\u2019s anti-rationalist stance? This seminar, going further than dedicating itself to the legacy of a single thinker, wishes to investigate the \u201clogic\u201d (or lack thereof) that attends posthumous acclaim, eponymity, and etiological myths, and to provide guidelines for a disciplined approach to the history, practice, and theory of reception.

We will look at the various ways in which contemporary philosophers of Judaism have dealt with suffering, evil and God, especially after the experience of the Shoah. We will examine the often repeated claim that Judaism has approached the philosophical and religious challenges of suffering more through an ethics of suffering than on the basis of a metaphysics of suffering. After an introductory discussion of Maimonides on the Book of Job, readings for the course may come from authors such as E. Lévinas, J.B. Soloveitchik, Y. Leibowitz, H. Jonas, A. Lichtenstein, D.W. Halivni, D. Shatz, and E. Berkovits. The course will culminate in a philosophical analysis of some of the most important writings of Primo Levi.

How did predicaments of the Enlightenment come to structure pro-slavery thought? What was the relationship between liberalism and abolitionism? How did philosophical principles related to the development of the natural sciences support or undermine projects of national independence and/or of social emancipation (such as women's and labor rights)? And what did literature have to do with these issues? Among the authors we may study are Francisco de Arango y Parreño, Félix Varela, José Antonio Saco, Gertrudis Gómez de Avellaneda, Condesa de Merlín, Eugenio María de Hostos, Enrique José Varona, José de Jesús Galván, José Martí, and Luisa Capetillo.

V\u000aIn classical mythology, Astraea, the goddess of justice, chastity, and truth, was the last of the immortals to leave earth with the decline of the ages. Her return was to signal the dawn of a new Golden Age. During the Spanish seventeenth century, her myth was utilized by a number of playwrights, but particularly by Calderón de la Barca to delve into a series of questions. As an astral myth, it allowed poets to delve into astrological matters at a time when this art still enjoyed much popularity. The course will analyze the presence of planets and zodiacal signs, of miraculous stars and horoscopes to discuss the topical uses of astrology and the limits of its orthodoxy. While Aratus discussed the astronomical implications of the myth in ancient times, Virgil transformed it into an imperial myth, proclaiming that she would return to Rome without the need for ekpyrosis. Thus, Philip IV appropriated the myth in Spain to proclaim the renovation that was to take place during his reign. Playwrights would thus praise Philip through this myth. It also has been argued that Astraea also served to point to the regime\u2019s failures. The course will then study the political implications of the myth. Among the plays by Calderón that will be included are: La gran Cenobia, La vida es sueño, El mayor encanto amor, Los tres mayores prodigios, and El monstruo de los jardines.

We will read portions of sixteenth-century Spanish translations of the Odyssey and the Aeneid, travel writing such as the Viaje de Turquía, captivity narratives by Miguel de Cervantes and Diego Galán, short stories by María de Zayas and Lope de Vega, and poems by Garcilaso de la Vega, Fernando de Herrera, and morisco authors.

The ultimate goal of this course is to distill more precise meanings of "realism," "critical realism,"and "naturalism" in nineteenth-century Russian through analysis of works by Gogol, Turgenev, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Aleksandr Ostrovsky, Goncharov, Saltykov-Shchedrin, and Kuprin.

The change of political regimes has only been outpaced by the change of aesthetic regimes, from realism to symbolism, and then from socialist realism to post-modernism. We sample the major writers, texts, and literary doctrines, paying close attention to the way they responded and contributed to historical events. This course counts as the third part of the survey of Russian literature. Texts in English.

V\u000aNobel Laureate in Literature in 1970, Alexander Solzhenitsyn (1918\u20132008) is best known as an advocate for human rights in the Soviet Union, from which he was expelled in 1974. As with Tolstoy a century before, Solzhenitsyn\u2019s vast moral authority rested upon the reputation he gained as a novelist in the early 1960s. We will read his novels One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich and Cancer Ward as innovative and complex fictions in the tradition of the Russian novel. We will then read the first volume of his monumental Archipelago GULAG, which he called \u201can experiment in literary investigation,\u201d to see how he brought his artistic talents to bear on the hidden and traumatic history of repression under Stalin. At the center of the course will be the tensions in Solzhenitsyn\u2019s work between fiction and history, individual and society, modernity and tradition, humanism and ideology.

V\u000aAfter the fall of Rome in 476 CE, literatures of the Latin West and\u2014predominantly Greek-speaking\u2014Eastern provinces of the Roman empire followed two very different paths. Covering both religious and secular genres, we will survey some of the most interesting texts written in the Christian East in the period from 330 CE (foundation of Constantinople) to the late 17th century (Westernization of Russia). Our focus throughout will be on continuities within particular styles and types of discourse (court entertainment, rhetoric, historiography, hagiography) and their functions within East Christian cultures. Readings will include Digenes Akritas and Song of Igor\u2019s Campaign, as well as texts by Emperor Julian the Apostate, Gregory of Nazianzus, Emphraim the Syrian, Anna Comnena, Psellos, Ivan the Terrible, and Archbishop Avvakum.

In addition to analyzing the formal properties of verse, we will inquire into their relevance for the articulation of poetic genres and, more broadly, the history of literary (and sub-literary) systems. There will be some emphasis on Graeco-Roman quantitative metrics, its afterlife, and the evolution of Germanic and Slavic syllabo-tonic verse. No prerequisites, but a working knowledge of one European language besides English is strongly recommended.

V\u000aThe goal of this course is a thorough treatment of Kafka's literary work in its Central European, more specifically Czech, context. In critical scholarship, Kafka and his work are often alienated from his Prague milieu. The course revisits the Prague of Kafka's time, with particular reference to Josefov (the Jewish ghetto), Das Prager Deutsch, and Czech/German/Jewish relations of the prewar and interwar years. We discuss most of Kafka's major prose works within this context and beyond (including The Castle, The Trial, and the stories published during his lifetime), as well as selected critical approaches to his work.

Albanian is of relevance for Indo-Europeanists, Balkanists, Classicists, Islamicists, and any social scientist with an interest in Southeastern Europe. In addition to being the majority language in Albania and Kosovo, it is spoken by compact populations in all their neighboring countries, as well as by old enclaves in Italy, Croatia, Bulgaria, Turkey, Romania, and Ukraine, and by more recent émigré groups in Western Europe, North America, and Australia. The course focuses on giving students an understanding of the grammatical structure of Albanian as well as sufficient reading knowledge for the independent development of the ability to pursue research.

V\u000aEastern Europe has menaced the "enlightened" West for centuries. It remains to this day a valuable source for negotiating the West\u2019s phantasies. One need only look at the rich and varied story of the vampire through popular culture from the 18th-century revenant to the 21st-century sex symbol and family man to confirm this fascination. Eastern Europe (and I use this term here to conform to popular discourse) is the West\u2019s necessary construct to enforce the ideation of its own health and weal. In this course contemporary horror film produced both within and without Eastern Europe\u2014and at times in partnership with the \u201cWest\u201d\u2014but all with the East as haunt, landscape, and affect are discussed with the West\u2019s and East\u2019s anxieties (social, political, artistic) in mind. Films include Eli Roth\u2019s Hostel franchise, Julie Delpy\u2019s The Countess, Timur Bekmambetov\u2019s Night Watch and Day Watch, Pavel Ruminov\u2019s Dead Daughters, Nacho Cerdà\u2019s The Abandoned, György Palfi\u2019s Taxidermia, and the highly controversial A Serbian Film directed by Sr\u0111an Spasojevi\u0107. Readings range from work on defining the horror genre to philosophies of anxiety to critical interrogations of specific films. This class contains films with scenes that ought to be disturbing.

In order to understand the development of Proto-Slavic into the existing Slavic languages and dialects, we focus on a set of basic phenomena. The course is specifically concerned with making students aware of factors that led to the breakup of the Slavic unity and the emergence of the individual languages. Drawing on the historical development, we touch upon such salient typological characteristics of the modern languages such as the rich set of morphophonemic alternations, aspect, free word order, and agreement.

V\u000aThis course will explore post-World War II film from Poland\u2014approaching the works both as examples of the cinematic art in the region and as a lens through which to view developments and transformations in East European culture. We will view ten films by most renowned directors from Poland. The course will assess what the end of World War II, joining the Eastern Bloc, the fall of communism, and finally the entry into post-Soviet Europe have meant for the film culture and the Polish national film tradition. We will also consider how Eastern European cinematic discourse is undergoing\u2014or should undergo\u2014revision, viewing it as an increasingly transnational phenomenon, rather than the example of a national film industry. The films will be viewed in the original language with English subtitles.

V\u000aRock and punk music played a significant role in subverting the power of the Soviet system among the youth cultures of the Eastern bloc countries. These two types of music became extremely interesting artistic and subversive cultural realms during the Cold War in Poland, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, the USSR, and other countries of the Bloc. \u201cThe Plastic People of the Universe\u201d from Czechoslovakia, \u201cMaanam\u201d and \u201cPerfect\u201d from Poland, \u201cTime Machine\u201d from the USSR, among others, accompanied and unified the younger generations in searching for their identity in the reality of the totally controlling and ominous communist state. Music became an integral part of young people\u2019s lives and actively participated in the crucial social change of 1989\u2014the fall of the communist system. Massive popularity of Western rock and punk music behind the Iron Curtain along with the music created by artists from the Eastern Bloc will be explored in detail in this course.

V\u000aIn this course, we dwell on Witold Gombrowicz the philosopher, exploring the components of his authorial style and concepts that substantiate his claim to both the literary and the philosophical spheres. Entangled in an ongoing battle with basic philosophical tenets and, indeed, with existence itself, this erudite Polish author is a prime example of a 20th century modernist whose philosophical novels explode with uncanny laughter. In contrast to many of his contemporaries, who established their reputations as writers/philosophers, Gombrowicz applied distinctly literary models to the same questions that they explored. We investigate these models in depth, as we focus on Gombrowicz\u2019s novels, philosophical lectures, and some of his autobiographical writings. With an insight from recent criticism of these primary texts, we seek answers to the more general question: What makes this author a philosopher?

The ultimate goal of this course is to distill more precise meanings of "realism," "critical realism,"and "naturalism" in nineteenth-century Russian through analysis of works by Gogol, Turgenev, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Aleksandr Ostrovsky, Goncharov, Saltykov-Shchedrin, and Kuprin.

The change of political regimes has only been outpaced by the change of aesthetic regimes, from realism to symbolism, and then from socialist realism to post-modernism. We sample the major writers, texts, and literary doctrines, paying close attention to the way they responded and contributed to historical events. This course counts as the third part of the survey of Russian literature. Texts in English.

V\u000aLaughter is universal but its causes are culturally determined. A joke in one culture can be a shaggy dog story in another. The figure of the trickster occurs in many places and times and under many guises. Stereotypes can be revelatory about those who deploy them. At the same time, humor can be both an outlet and a danger. There is a special word in Russian for those sentenced to prison for telling political jokes. This course focuses on Balkan humor, which, like the Balkans themselves, is located in a space where "Western Europe," "Eastern Europe," "Central Europe," "The Mediterranean", "The Levant," and the "Near/Middle East" intersect in various ways (linguistically and culturally), compete for dominance or resist domination, and ultimately create a unique\u2014albeit fuzzily bounded\u2014subject of study.\u000aIn this course, we examine the poetics of laughter in the Balkans. In order to do so, we introduce humor as both cultural and transnational. We unpack the multiple layers of cultural meaning in the logic of \u201cBalkan humor.\u201d We also examine the functions and mechanisms of laughter, both in terms of cultural specificity and general practice and theories of humor. Thus, the study of Balkan humor will help us elucidate the \u201cBalkan\u201d and the \u201cWorld,\u201d and will provide insight not only into cultural mores and social relations, but into the very notion of \u201cfunny.\u201d Our own laughter in class will be the best measure of our success\u2014both cultural and intellectual.

We also think about differing models of masculinity, the figure of the gypsy as a metaphor for the national self in relation to the West, and the myths Balkans tell about themselves. We conclude by considering the role that the imperative to belong to Western Europe played in the Yugoslav wars of succession. Some possible texts/films are Ivo Andric, Bosnian Chronicle; Aleko Konstantinov, Baj Ganyo; Emir Kusturica, Underground; and Milcho Manchevski, Before the Rain.

V\u000aEveryone is a member of a family. The family has been one of the most important social institutions in every society throughout history. But the shape that families take, the functions they fill, and the problems they face vary historically and cross-culturally. So families in Sweden look different from and act differently than families in Saudi Arabia or Brazil. And American families today differ dramatically from a century ago. This course looks at families from a sociological perspective, focusing on the family as a social group, the institution of the family, and differences in families within and across societies. We consider how public policies\u2014such as those aiding needy families (TANF) and recognizing same-sex marriage\u2014affect families and how family members work to influence public policies. We draw on contemporary media representations of families and their challenges in order to evaluate sociological theories. The course follows lecture/discussion format. Students are responsible for three one-page papers on topics drawn from the course, a mid-term, and a final.

V\u000aThe modern period was associated with industrial production, class society, rationalization, disenchantment, the welfare state, and the belief in salvation by society. Current societies are characterized by a culture of consumption; consumption is central to lifestyles and identity, it is instantiated in our technological reality and the complex of advertising media, structures of wanting and shopping. Starting from the question \u201cwhy do we want things\u201d we will discuss theories and empirical studies that focus on consumption and identity formation; on shopping and the consumption of symbolic signs; on consumption as linked to the re-enchantment of modernity; as a process of distinction and of the globalization of frames; and as related to time and information. The course is built around approaches that complement the \u201cproductionist\u201d focus of the social sciences. Students interested in economic sociology and anthropology can supplement this course by one on Markets and Money.

V\u000aFrom at least the Renaissance until some time around the middle of the twentieth century, social class was the pre-eminent, generalized determinant of life chances in European and, eventually, American societies. Social class had great effect on one's social standing; economic well-being; political power; access to knowledge; and even longevity, health, and height. In that time, there was hardly an aspect of life that was not profoundly influenced by social class. In the ensuing period, the effects of social class have receded greatly, and perhaps have even vanished. In their place formal schooling has become the great generalized influence over who gets access to the desiderata of social life, including food, shelter, political power, and medical care. So it is that schooling is sociologically interesting for reasons that go well beyond education. The purpose of this course is to review what is known about the long-term effects of schooling.

Through weekly readings and discussion of influential texts, this course surveys the development of urban ethnography from the First Chicago School of the early twentieth century through current-day research. We will explore the substantive issues that have historically shaped urban life\u2014from community dynamics to poverty to social control\u2014as well as the epistemological and methodological concerns faced by those who study urban populations. The aim is to ground students in the foundational literature while preparing them to conduct their own urban ethnographies in the future.

V\u000aThis course introduces empirical findings on gendered and sexual experiences in contemporary family life as a means of understanding gender and sexuality as complex social processes that structure our everyday live. We study both the ways families reflect broader gender and sexual structures and inequalities and how they create and perpetuate them. Specific areas of family life we explore through a gender and sexualities lens include cohabitation and marriage, reproduction and parenting, domestic and emotional labor, and sexual desires and practices.

V\u000aWhat constitutes radicalism in cinema? All too often the expression radical has been reserved for films that come under the rubric of \u201cart\u201d, \u201cparallel\u201d or \u201cthird\u201d cinema. Formally these films share certain commonalities with Latin American, Eastern European cinemas and even the various European new waves. Is it possible however to read a radical politics and ethics into films and filmmakers who did not self-consciously describe themselves as such? To what extent does political cinema and extra-cinematic discussions of such films compromise questions of formalism? This course will analyze these and related issues by looking closely at Indian cinema from 1947 to 1977. We will be watching and discussing both \u201cpopular\u201d and \u201cart\u201d films to understand the ways in which they have addressed (or not) issues of mass politics, the state, and the people. You do not need a prior background in Indian films or Indian history to take this class but it is absolutely essential that you attend all the screenings and participate in class discussion.

V\u000aThis course examines the music of South Asia as an aesthetic domain with both unity and particularity in the region. The unity of the North and South Indian classical traditions is treated historically and analytically, with special emphasis placed on correlating their musical and mythological aspects. The classical traditions are contrasted with regional, tribal, and folk music with respect to fundamental conceptualizations of music and the roles it plays in society. In addition, the repertories of Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Sri Lanka, as well as states and nations bordering the region, are covered. Music is also considered as a component of myth, religion, popular culture, and the confrontation with modernity.

V\u000aThe notion of differential citizenship is a topic that exercises scholars the world over.  In particular, those interested in issues of feminism and ethnicity have studied why women (and then some women more than others) or particular social groups experience disenfranchisement more than their counterparts.  This is so even when officially many cultures grant them formal equality before the law. This course explores issues of disenfranchisement, inequality, and violence through a focus on South Asia.  We will begin with a set of theoretical readings mainly John Locke and John Stuart Mill whose works demonstrate some early strands of thinking about the political and cultural role (or the lack thereof) of women within the (fraternal) social contract.  We will then move to contemporary works such as Joan Scott\u2019s Only Paradoxes to Offer (selections), Parite: Sexual Equality and the Crisis of French Universalism (selections), Leila Ahmed\u2019s A Quiet Revolution (selections), Amy Dru Stanley\u2019s From Bondage to Contract (selections) to frame the issue of differential citizenship and inequality in a historical and global context.  Following this we turn to South Asia with a particular focus on gender and caste inequality and the violence unleashed by majoritarian politics (both overt and covert).

This course aims to answer such questions through the stories of five famous couples in pre-modern Indian literature. These couples\u2014some divine, some human and some mixed\u2014will provide multiple perspectives on central themes in Indian culture such as love, desire, and devotion as well as on the advantages and disadvantages of being human and/or of being divine where love is concerned. Readings in this course will include translations of classical Sanskrit texts their retellings in various regional languages and a few modern adaptations.

V\u000aSouth Asia has a rich historical record, from the very beginnings of our species to the present, and yet the earlier part of this record is surprisingly little-known outside specialist circles. This course provides a broad overview of South Asian archaeology and early history, from the beginnings of agricultural production to the expansion of states and empires in the early days of textual records. We cover critical anthropological processes such as the origins and expansion of agriculture, the development of one of the world\u2019s first urban societies\u2014the Harappan or Indus civilization\u2014the growth and institutionalization of social inequalities, and changing contexts of social and religious life. While the course actually extends a bit beyond the time of the Buddha, its major focus is on the periods up to and including the Early Historic. No prior experience of either South Asia or archaeology is assumed; indeed, we will think quite a bit about the nature of evidence and about how we know about the more distant past.

V\u000aThis course is recommended for students throughout the natural and social sciences who want a broad background in statistical methodology and exposure to probability models and the statistical concepts underlying the methodology. Probability is developed for the purpose of modeling outcomes of random phenomena. Random variables and their expectations are studied; including means and variances of linear combinations and an introduction to conditional expectation. Binomial, Poisson, normal and other standard probability distributions are considered. Some probability models are studied mathematically, and others are studied via simulation on a computer. Sampling distributions and related statistical methods are explored mathematically, studied via simulation, and illustrated on data. Methods include, but are not limited to, inference for means and variances for one- and two-sample problems, correlation, and simple linear regression. Graphical description and numerical data description are used for exploration, communication of results, and comparing mathematical consequences of probability models and data. Mathematics employed is to the level of univariate calculus, but it is less demanding than that required by STAT 24400.

V\u000aThis course employs a practice in the fundamental theory of play direction and the role of the director in collaboration with the development of textual analysis. By examining five diversely different texts using three different approaches to play analysis (Aristotle, Stanislavski, Ball) students begin developing a method of directing for the stage in support of the written text. In alternating weeks, students implement textual analysis in building an understanding of directorial concept, theme, imagery and staging through rehearsal and in-class presentations of three-minute excerpts from the play analysis the previous week. The culmination is a final five-minute scene combining the tools of direction with a method of analysis devised over the entire course.

V\u000aThe relationship to ones partners is the single most predictably generative asset we have on stage. How can we use this reliable relationship to create work that is truthful and grounded in the real, so that we can forge experience with audiences rather than asking them to "suspend disbelief." In this class we will explore action and liveness in theater performance and creation. At the very core of the theatrical act is the live interaction between the actor and her/his partners. We will look at improvisation, action art, and 500 Clown technique as ways of finding ourselves present on stage. There will be writing (creative and papers) and reading (you know...books), but this class is mostly a time to acquire knowledge with the body. We will be stretching physically and emotionally each class period. Journaling will be required, as will clothes that allow for free movement with no flashiness or logos. (Burlap sack not required). Performance experience not required. If you're not interested in performance though, why are still reading this? 500 Clown is a Clown-theater company founded in 1999. The core members of which have developed a way of teaching performance which produces visceral and accessible theater. Adrian Danzig is the founding Artistic Director of 500 Clown.

V\u000aThe course is a survey of major trends and theatrical accomplishments in drama from the ancient Greeks through the Renaissance: Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Aristophanes, classical Sanskrit theater, medieval religious drama, Japanese Noh drama, Kyd, Marlowe, Shakespeare, and Molière, along with some consideration of dramatic theory by Aristotle, Sir Philip Sidney, Corneille, and others. Students have the option of writing essays or putting on short scenes in cooperation with other members of the course. The goal of these scenes is not to develop acting skill but, rather, to discover what is at work in the scene and to write up that process in a somewhat informal report. End-of-week workshops, in which individual scenes are read aloud dramatically and discussed, are optional but highly recommended.

V\u000aIn July 2015, the Bavarian State Opera in Munich will present the world premiere of a piece tentatively titled Jephta's Daughter, to be directed by Saar Magal (choreographer and director, Tel Aviv) and conceived by Magal in collaboration with University of Chicago professor David Levin. Magal and Levin will offer a laboratory course in which to prepare the piece. As presently conceived, the piece will combine theater, dance, oratorio, film, contemporary composition, and a variety of contemporary performance idioms to adapt and interrogate the story of Jephta's daughter (in the Book of Judges, from which the story is adapted, she remains nameless). We are hoping to attract students keen to explore a broad cross-section of materials through seminar-style discussion and experimentation on stage. (We will work through biblical criticism, films like Harmony Korine's Spring Breakers (2013) or Ulrich Seidl's Paradise: Love-Faith-Hope, operas like Mozart's Idomeneo, oratorios like Handel's Jephta and Carissimi's Jephta, and a range of critical theory, including Rene Girard's Violence and the Sacred and Derek Hughes's Culture and Sacrifice). Stage work will encompass improvisational, physical, and text-based work. Students with an interest in any of the following are especially welcome: adaptation, theater practice, performance theory, dramaturgy, design, and/or editing.

V\u000aTeam-taught by Catherine Sullivan and visiting composers Sean Griffin and George Lewis, Improvisational Dramaturgy explores interdisciplinary and improvisational strategies for performance. Course work will be integrated with the development of a staging of an operatic composition by Lewis. Tentatively titled "Afterword," the piece explores the ecology of Lewis's 2008 award-winning book, A Power Stronger Than Itself: The A.A.C.M. and American Experimental Music. Issues of public assembly, spatial language, music as social text, documentation, collaboration, and the dynamics of improvisation will be explored in theory, history, and practice. The class will work as an ensemble, contributing original material and working with various groups both on and off campus. Students working in all disciplines are welcome. This course is sponsored by a Mellon Fellowship for Arts Practice and Scholarship at the Gray Center for Arts and Inquiry.

V\u000aBeckett is conventionally typed as the playwright of minimalist scenes of unremitting bleakness but his experiments with theatre and film echo the irreverent play of popular culture (vaudeville on stage and screen, e.g., Chaplin and Keaton) as well as the artistic avant garde (Jarry). This course will juxtapose these early 20th century models with Beckett\u2019s plays on stage and screen and those of his contemporaries (Ionesco, Genet, Duras). Contemporary texts include Vinaver, Minyana, in French, Pinter, Churchill, Kane in English. Theorists include Barthes, Badiou, Bert States, and others.

V\u000aMedia ecology examines how the structure and content of our media environments\u2014online and offline, in words, images, sounds, and textures\u2014affect human perception, understanding, feeling, and value; or alternatively, media ecology investigates the massive and dynamic interrelation of processes and objects, beings and things, patterns and matter. At stake are issues about agency\u2014human or material\u2014and about determinism\u2014how does society or culture interact with or shape its technologies, or vice versa? This course investigates theories of media ecology by exploring systems of meanings that humans embody (cultural, social, ecological) in conjunction with the emerging field of software studies about the cultural, political, social, and aesthetic impacts of software (e.g., code, interaction, interface). In our actual and virtual environments, how do we understand performing our multiple human embodiments in relation to other bodies (organism or machine) in pursuit of social or political goals?

V\u000aDrawing is often understood as a means to an end. The drawing, since the early Renaissance, has stood as an iconic representation for how thinking works: In preparation lines are forged to flesh out form, strike propositions, or experiment in possibilities. What this has come to mean historically is that drawing is a stage looking to an inevitable greater focus in another medium. Drawings will lead to final paintings, sculptures, or moving images. But, sometimes too, drawings believe in themselves to be their own economy, to be succinct, and to be in their own right a finished statement. Sometimes a drawing is the only way a set of criteria can be made clear. In this course, we will analyze the nature of drawing\u2019s history and embrace the notion of process as a questionable thing. If drawing is a form of vitality, then why not consider it as an end? Through exercises and problems posed, drawing will be a process of understanding and a making known, while at once being a venture into a seeing through, to drawing, its primordial function, and the making of a finite work as a statement in itself.

V\u000aAdvanced problems in sculpture is class that is open to all manifestation of sculptural practice broadly defined, including performance and film/video. A particular focus of the class will be spent considering issues of presence/the index, material histories, economic determination and societal legibility. Readings on sculptural history from the 19th through the 21st century will be used to illuminate contemporary concerns and issues. Prerequisites of at least introduction to sculpture will be required or instructors permission.

V\u000aale·a·tor·ic: adj \u005c\u02cc\u0101-l\u0113-\u0259-\u02c8t\u022fr-ik: characterized by chance or indeterminate elements. This studio course addresses how artists throughout time and across cultures have embraced chance and \u201crandomness\u201d as an integral part of the creative process. Through a series of studio projects, you will be challenged to explore how \u201cofficial\u201d Western aesthetic canons of taste (such as artistic skill, control, and \u201cgenius\u201d) were brought into question through chance and aleatoric strategies, particularly during the 20th century. This opened doors to experimentation with unorthodox methodologies, exploration of the unconscious, re-consideration of so-called \u201coutsider\u201d art\u2014and more. Readings, discussions, and field trips put these practices into cultural and theoretical context. Although this course employs drawing-based tools for developing ideas, you will be afforded ample room to expand beyond 2D\u2014into sculpture, video, installation, photography, performance, and/or hybrids forms\u2014in order to realize a clear and contemporary response to our theme as a final project.

V\u000aThis course is an exploration of select texts for performance written by performance artists primarily but not entirely operating within the context of art. Via historical context and literary technique, students read, discuss, and analyze texts by various authors spanning the history of performance art: Hugo Ball, John Cage, Richard Foreman, Carolee Schneeman, Joseph Beuys, Karen Finley, Nature Theater of Oklahoma, John Leguizamo, and create and perform their own writing. Field trips and attendance at first class are required.

V\u000aLight, space-time, movement, and color; these are the mediums of photography which the student is encouraged to question and work with throughout this course. What is color? What does it do? We will analyze the nature of photography, \u201cwriting with light,\u201d through the specific exploration and use of color by working hands-on in its control, distribution, and manipulation. Techniques in non-traditional color printing, as well as experimentation, working against popular conventions and methodologies in photography are introduced and encouraged. Being grounded in the mechanical and technical basis of photography leads us to pursue understanding of the mediums of light, space-time, and movement, all inseparable from knowledge of the physics of our world. The goal is to experiment, investigate, and share how these core phenomena, the foundation of photography, shape the way one makes and takes a photographic image, how one sees the world.

V\u000aWe will address questions regarding what the photograph pictures as opposed to what the photograph \u201cmeans,\u201d giving close attention to sussing out a more precise ontological mapping of the relationship between pictures and photography. Despite our long-standing knowledge that what we see, how we see, and how we \u201cpicture\u201d is not natural but rather a complex negotiation of physiological, psychological, historical, and social factors, the photograph\u2019s ubiquity naturalizes its ways of describing. What is \u201cpictured\u201d in a photograph is regularly taken as evidentiary, and in identity discourse, what is pictured matters. However, like ink squiggles on a white page that form letters and words\u2014creating a whole complex of signification subject to interpretation\u2014what the photograph actually means is in fact rarely self-evident and equally relative. This course builds on the symposium of the same name to be held in November 2014 in conjunction with an exhibition at the Logan Center, The Faculty of Belief, co-curated by Letinsky and Monika Szewczyk. Through a variety of perspectives including readings and students' art production, we will examine the lamination of content and subject within photography.

V\u000aDesigned as a complementary course to the DOVA sculpture sequence, Shopcraft explores the tools and techniques available to students in the wood shop. Topics covered include shop safety; the properties of woods; the planning and material selection process for sculpture, furniture, and other woodworking applications; the care and use of hand tools; and interpreting and creating scale drawings and conceptual plans. A series of small projects designed to challenge and expand students' design, drafting, and woodworking skills are assigned. In addition, students are invited to incorporate projects from sculpture classes or their individual studio practice into the course.

V\u000aThis class aims to problematize both computerized and manual approaches to reproduction in wood and metal. Through discussion and project development, we will find productive space to employ hybrid processes, while maintaining critical inquiry into the meaning and conceptual avenues they create. We will focus on the following prototyping equipment: CNC, Laser Cutter, and 3-D printer. Additionally, welding and woodworking are major components to this class. It is not required that you have previous experience working with either of these materials, just fortitude and enthusiasm to learn about them.

Along with questions of film technique and style, we consider the notion of the cinema as an institution that comprises an industrial system of production, social and aesthetic norms and codes, and particular modes of reception. Films discussed include works by Hitchcock, Porter, Griffith, Eisenstein, Lang, Renoir, Sternberg, and Welles.

V\u000aThis class is an multidisciplinary intensive into the ways in which artistic production is dependent on and part of larger cultural tropes. Utilizing contemporary culture as a framework, how does art form connective tissues with the worlds that happen outside of the artists studio? Visual art is a communicative form that requires subject matter and this class will investigate the myriad of ways that artists mine culturally meaningful materials, forms, and images as both subjects and as palette. Participation in several field trips and out-of-class film screenings is required. Reference materials are drawn from a variety of disciplines.

V\u000aRock n' Roll has long had a kinship with the visual arts. Whether it was artists who got interested and became part of the  music scene, or musicians influenced by artists; there seems to be a sense of common cause. While there could be numerous reasons for these affinities none perhaps is more significant  than a desire for new forms. This desire to break with established convention curiously stems from both  a rage for authenticity and conversely a delight in artifice, camp, and kitsch. Art-Rock then is problematic that gives us access to larger cultural questions that motivate music and artistic practice. This class will endeavor to understand what it means to be a "cross-over artist" in the broadest sense of the term and seek to further understand the mysterious group dynamics involved in the composition of a  rock band. Equal parts theory and practice, this OPC Seminar will result in the production of a concert and all attendant materials such as posters, press releases, t-shirts etc. Readings will include Dan Graham's Rock My Religion, Super Natural Strategies for Making a Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll Group by Ian Svenonius, Kim Gordon's Is It My Body, Dave Hickey's Air Guitar, among others. Special guests will lecture on their work with subject including Anthony Elms and others to be announced.

V\u000aStudents in this course screen and discuss films to consider whether there is a Chicago style of filmmaking. We trace how the city informs documentary, educational, industrial, narrative feature, and avant-garde films. If there is a Chicago style of filmmaking, one must look at the landscape of the city; and the design, politics, cultures, and labor of its people, as well as how they live their lives. The protagonists and villains in these films are the politicians and community organizers, our locations are the neighborhoods, and the set designers are Mies van der Rohe and the Chicago Housing Authority.

Studio skills are developed while contending with the central task of articulating ideas through a resistant medium. Toward the end of the quarter, students who wish to apply for the Honors Track may submit their applications to the Department. Visits to museums, galleries, and other cultural and commercial sites required, as is attendance at designated events.

Whether assailed as the product of colonial orientalism or celebrated as the ur-subjectivity of those who resist it (or something in between), the claims of, to, and about indigeneity continue to excite and demand attention scholarly and political. Indeed some argue that politics of indigeneity have gained unique traction in recent decades, as indigenous actors, scholars, and their advocates have pressed for changes to legal, political, and cultural/scientific regimes that have indigenous affairs as their chief objects of inquiry. One need only consider the 2007 passage of the UN Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the legal decisions acknowledging the force of native title in the Supreme Courts of Australia and Canada, and even the changes in various regimes of research\u00a0concerning the social scientific study of native peoples and/or the representation of their material culture, all of which happened less than 20 years ago.

In the mid-20th century, the long-standing ideal of an American melting-pot began to recede. The rise of racial pride, ushered in by the Civil Rights era, made way for the emergence of ethnic identity/pride movements, and multiculturalisms, more broadly, became privileged.

In this context, it has become not only possible, but often desirable, to be at the same time American, white, and an ethnic.

The level and character of human vulnerability matters and has implications for physical health, psychological well being, the character of culture, and mental health status. The balance between the two (i.e., risks and protective factors) can be influenced by ethnic group membership and identifiability (e.g., skin color). The cultural contexts where growth and development take place play a significant role in life course human development. As a globally admired cultural context with a particular national identity, one of America\u2019s foundational tenets is that citizenship promises the privilege of freedom, allows access to social benefits, and holds sacred the defense of rights. Our centuries-old cultural context and national identity as a liberty-guaranteeing democracy also presents challenges. The implied identity frequently makes it difficult to acknowledge that the depth of experience and its determinative nature may be but skin deep.\u00a0 In America, there continues to be an uneasiness and palpable personal discomfort whenever discussions concerning ethnic diversity, race, color and the Constitutional promise and actual practice of equal opportunity occur. Other nations are populated with vulnerable humans, as well, and experience parallel dissonance concerning the social tolerance of human diversity.\n,Given the shared status of human vulnerability, the course unpacks and analyzes how differences in ethnicity, skin color and other indicators of group membership impact vulnerability and opportunity for diverse groups. Specifically, the course analyzes the balance between risk level and protective factor presence and examines the consequent physical health status, psychological well-being, and mental health outcomes for its dissimilar citizens.

Beyond close examination of the works themselves, among the themes that will receive considerable attention for the ways they bear upon his art are Michelangelo\u2019s fraught relationship with patrons such as the Medici and a succession of popes; his complex devotion to and rivalry with ancient classical art and his living rivalry with Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Bramante, and others; his changing attitude towards religion, especially his engagement with the Catholic Reform and some of its key personalities such as Vittoria Colonna; his sexuality and how it might bear on the representation of gender in his art and poetry; his \u201cofficial\u201d biographies created by the devotees Giorgio Vasari (1550, 1568) and Ascanio Condivii (1553) during Michelangelo\u2019s lifetime and some of the most influential moments in the artist\u2019s complex, sometimes ambivalent, reception over the centuries; new approaches and ideas about Michelangelo that have emerged in recent decades from the unabated torrent of scholarship and, especially, the restoration and scientific imaging of many of his works.

Second, science has been used to explain aesthetic effects (e.g., Helmholtz\u2019s work on the way painters achieve visual effects or musicians achieve tonal effects). Third, aesthetic means have been used to convey scientific conceptions (e.g., through illustrations in scientific volumes or through aesthetically affective and effective writing). Finally philosophers have stepped back to consider the relationship between scientific knowing and aesthetic comprehension (e.g., Kant and Bas van Fraassen). In this course, we will consider these four modes of relationship. The first part of the quarter will be devoted to Kant, reading carefully his third critique; then we will turn to Goethe and Helmholtz, both feeling the impact of Kant, and to Wells, a student of T.

Experts must meet many familiar standards for successful writing: clear style, logical organization, and persuasive argument. But because they work with specialized knowledge, experts also face particular writing difficulties: they must be clear about complexities and specific about abstractions; they must use uncomplicated organization for very complicated ideas; they must create straightforward logic for intricate arguments; they must be concise but not incomplete, direct but not simplistic; they must clarify the obscure but not repeat the obvious; and they must anticipate the demands of aggressively skeptical readers. The seminars do not repeat or extend the substantive discussion of the Humanities class; they use the discussions and assignments from those classes as a tool for the advanced study of writing. We study various methods not only for the construction of sophisticated and well-structured arguments but also for understanding the complications and limits of those arguments. These seminars also address issues of readership and communication within expert communities.

We examine whether wisdom really exists or whether it is simply a creation of mythology or fiction or wishful thinking. Further, the course considers whether and how wisdom can be studied scientifically, that is, how it can be measured and experimentally manipulated. Readings are drawn from philosophy, classics, history, behavioral economics, neuroscience, and psychology. In addition to considering the theoretical concept of wisdom and how it can be studied scientifically, the course explores how concepts of wisdom can be applied in business, education, medicine, and the law.

The second objective of the course, then, will be to produce a research proposal, developing in the process a better understanding of what scholarly research entails and what preliminary work needs to be done in order for a research project to proceed. The drafting of the research proposal will follow a set of the very same guidelines that will structure the writing of your BA research proposal (due to the IS at the beginning of the Spring Quarter of your third year) and your BA thesis.

Through the investigation of the Jewish and Italian examples, this discussion-style course will look at how ethnicity is manifested in, for example, class, religion, gender, nostalgia, and place, as well as how each of these categories is in turn constitutive of ethnic identity. The course will illustrate that there is no fixed endpoint of assimilation or acculturation, after which a given individual is fully \u201cAmerican,\u201d but that ethnic identity, and its various constituent elements, persists and perpetually evolves, impacting individual identities and experience, and both local/group specific and larger cultural narratives even many generations after immigration.", "title": "America's White Ethnics: Contemporary Italian- and Jewish-American Ethnic Identities."}}, {"pk": 1490, "model": "recomendr.course", "fields": {"department": "JWSC", "course_number": 25000, "description": "\nThis three quarter course introduces students to reading, writing, and speaking modern Hebrew.

Second, science has been used to explain aesthetic effects (e.g., Helmholtz\u2019s work on the way painters achieve visual effects or musicians achieve tonal effects). Third, aesthetic means have been used to convey scientific conceptions (e.g., through illustrations in scientific volumes or through aesthetically affective and effective writing).

This argument has not gone unanswered (for example, by Francis Collins in The Language of God and by Pope Benedict XVI in his Regensburg lecture). This course will examine the relationship between religious faith and reason. We will discuss four positions: (1) reason and faith are in conflict, and it is best to abandon science in favor of faith (religious fundamentalism); (2) reason and faith are in conflict, and it is best to abandon faith in favor of science (scientific atheism); (3) reason and faith do not make cognitive contact, and one can freely choose faith without conflict with reason (\"non-overlapping magisteria,\" fideism); (4) reason and faith do make cognitive contact but are mutually supporting, not in conflict (harmonious compatibilism). We will focus on contemporary debates but also consider their historical roots (for example, Aquinas, Leibniz, Voltaire, Hume, William James). Among the topics to be discussed will be the nature of reason and faith, arguments for and against the existence of God, the problem of evil, evolution and intelligent design, cosmology and the origin of the universe, the rationality of belief in miracles and the supernatural, and evolutionary and neuroscientific explanations of religious belief and religious experience.

During the Spanish seventeenth century, her myth was utilized by a number of playwrights, but particularly by Calder\u00f3n de la Barca to delve into a series of questions. As an astral myth, it allowed poets to delve into astrological matters at a time when this art still enjoyed much popularity. The course will analyze the presence of planets and zodiacal signs, of miraculous stars and horoscopes to discuss the topical uses of astrology and the limits of its orthodoxy. While Aratus discussed the astronomical implications of the myth in ancient times, Virgil transformed it into an imperial myth, proclaiming that she would return to Rome without the need for ekpyrosis. Thus, Philip IV appropriated the myth in Spain to proclaim the renovation that was to take place during his reign. Playwrights would thus praise Philip through this myth. It also has been argued that Astraea also served to point to the regime\u2019s failures. The course will then study the political implications of the myth.

Whether it was artists who got interested and became part of the\u00a0 music scene, or musicians influenced by artists; there seems to be a sense of common cause. While there could be numerous reasons for these affinities none perhaps is more significant\u00a0 than a desire for new forms. This desire to break with established convention curiously stems from both\u00a0 a rage for authenticity and conversely a delight in artifice, camp, and kitsch. Art-Rock then is problematic that gives us access to larger cultural questions that motivate music and artistic practice. This class will endeavor to understand what it means to be a \"cross-over artist\" in the broadest sense of the term and seek to further understand the mysterious group dynamics involved in the composition of a\u00a0 rock band. Equal parts theory and practice, this OPC Seminar will result in the production of a concert and all attendant materials such as posters, press releases, t-shirts etc. Readings will include Dan Graham's Rock My Religion, Super Natural Strategies for Making a Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll Group by Ian Svenonius, Kim Gordon's Is It My Body, Dave Hickey's Air Guitar, among others.
